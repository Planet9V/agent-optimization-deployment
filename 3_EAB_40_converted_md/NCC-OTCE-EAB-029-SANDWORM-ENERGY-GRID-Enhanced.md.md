🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Sandworm (Russian GRU Unit 74455) has executed a systematic 26-day energy grid vulnerability assessment campaign (July 10 - August 5, 2025) targeting North American critical energy infrastructure. This campaign represents a strategic escalation from disruptive attacks to comprehensive vulnerability mapping, with confirmed SCADA system access across 6 major power companies. The operation's methodical approach to mapping energy grid interdependencies and identifying critical control points suggests preparation for potential large-scale infrastructure destabilization during geopolitical tensions.

Critical Campaign Intelligence:

Infrastructure Scope: 6 major power companies with 15+ SCADA system penetrations

Geographic Distribution: Strategic focus on tri-state power grid interconnections

Technical Evolution: Advanced OT/IT convergence exploitation with industrial protocol abuse
