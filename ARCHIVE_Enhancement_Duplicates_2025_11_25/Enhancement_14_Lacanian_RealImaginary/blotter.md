## Decisions Log

### Decision 001 - Hierarchical Swarm Topology
**Date**: 2025-11-25
**Decision**: Use hierarchical topology with 2 coordinators (Research, Engineering)
**Rationale**: 10 agents too many for single coordinator; division by function reduces coordination overhead
**Impact**: COORDINATOR-1 manages 4 research agents, COORDINATOR-2 manages 6 engineering agents
**Decided By**: TASKMASTER initial design
**Status**: APPROVED

---

### Decision 002 - 8-Week Timeline with 2-Week Buffer
**Date**: 2025-11-25
**Decision**: 8-week primary timeline + 2-week stabilization (10 weeks total)
**Rationale**: Balances urgency with risk mitigation; 2-week buffer for integration issues
**Impact**: Stakeholders expect production system by 2026-01-26
**Decided By**: TASKMASTER planning
**Status**: APPROVED

---

### Decision 003 - Synthetic Data for Parallel Development
**Date**: 2025-11-25
**Decision**: Generate synthetic test data in Week 1 to unblock AGENT-5/6/7
**Rationale**: Avoid cascading delays if AGENT-2/3 data processing is slow
**Impact**: AGENT-5/6/7 can develop in parallel without waiting for real data
**Decided By**: Risk mitigation planning
**Status**: APPROVED

---

### Decision 004 - Schema Freeze Date (Week 4)
**Date**: 2025-11-25
**Decision**: Lock Neo4j schema by end of Week 4; no structural changes after
**Rationale**: Schema changes after Week 4 would require AGENT-9 pipeline rewrites
**Impact**: AGENT-8 must complete schema design by 2025-12-29
**Decided By**: Integration risk mitigation
**Status**: APPROVED

---

### Decision 005 - Blue-Green Deployment Strategy
**Date**: 2025-11-25
**Decision**: Use blue-green deployment for production cutover in Week 8
**Rationale**: Minimize downtime, enable instant rollback if issues detected
**Impact**: Requires duplicate infrastructure during cutover (2x cost for 4 hours)
**Decided By**: Production deployment planning
**Status**: APPROVED

---

## Issues & Blockers

### Issue 001 - VERIS Data Quality Concerns
**Opened**: 2025-11-25
**Reporter**: TASKMASTER (risk assessment)
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Description**: VERIS VCDB may have missing/incomplete incident data, reducing real threat detection accuracy
**Impact**: Potential reduction in AGENT-5 F1-score from 0.89 to 0.82
**Mitigation**:
  - Cross-validate with DBIR reports and Ponemon data (AGENT-2)
  - Build robust missing data handling (AGENT-5)
  - Fallback to CVE/exploit databases for technical risk scores
**Assigned To**: AGENT-2, AGENT-5
**Status**: OPEN (monitoring, mitigation planned)

---

### Issue 002 - Media Corpus Bias
**Opened**: 2025-11-25
**Reporter**: TASKMASTER (risk assessment)
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Description**: News corpus may over-represent certain threat types (e.g., APT nation-state attacks)
**Impact**: Skewed imaginary threat detection, higher false positive rate
**Mitigation**:
  - Diversify sources: News, vendor, conference, social media (AGENT-3)
  - Apply source weighting to reduce single-source bias (AGENT-6)
  - Expert review of narrative classifications
**Assigned To**: AGENT-3, AGENT-6
**Status**: OPEN (mitigation planned)

---

### Issue 003 - Neo4j Query Performance at Scale
**Opened**: 2025-11-25
**Reporter**: TASKMASTER (risk assessment)
**Severity**: HIGH
**Description**: Queries may slow with >10M nodes, making dashboard unusable (>10s query time)
**Impact**: Dashboard SLA violation, user adoption failure
**Mitigation**:
  - Implement graph indexes on high-cardinality properties (AGENT-8)
  - Use query caching for common patterns (AGENT-8)
  - Batch event ingestion to avoid real-time write bottleneck (AGENT-9)
  - Monitoring: Alert if query time >5s (50% of target)
**Assigned To**: AGENT-8, AGENT-9
**Status**: OPEN (monitoring planned, indexes in design)

## Lessons Learned (Updated Post-Completion)

### Lessons from Planning Phase (Week 0)

**What Worked Well**:
1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: 2,300+ line documentation before agent deployment reduces ambiguity
2. **Hierarchical Swarm Design**: 2 coordinators for 10 agents appears optimal based on similar projects
3. **Phase-Based Planning**: Clear milestones every 2 weeks enables adaptive replanning

**Areas for Improvement**:
1. **Earlier Stakeholder Engagement**: Should have involved stakeholders in Week 0 for faster approval
2. **Data Acquisition Planning**: Could have started VERIS download earlier (doesn't require approval)

**Carrying Forward**:
- Maintain 2,300+ line documentation standard for future enhancements
- Engage stakeholders during design phase (not after)
