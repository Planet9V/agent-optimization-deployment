## DECISION LOG

### Decision 001: Asimov Foundation as Theoretical Framework
**Date:** 2025-11-25
**Decision Maker:** System Architect
**Rationale:**
- Asimov's psychohistory provides established mathematical framework for population prediction
- "Individual unpredictable, crowd follows laws" aligns with cybersecurity population modeling
- Seldon Crisis concept maps cleanly to major breach events (SolarWinds, Colonial Pipeline)
- Literary foundation makes concept accessible to non-technical stakeholders

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Pure statistical modeling (less narrative coherence)
- Social physics approaches (less established in literature)
- Behavioral economics (individual-focused, not population-level)

**Impact:** High - Defines entire theoretical foundation for Enhancement 11

---

### Decision 002: 6-File Ingestion Scope
**Date:** 2025-11-25
**Decision Maker:** Data Architecture Team
**Files Selected:**
1. `01_Psychohistory_Population_Cyber_Behavior.md` (18,500 lines)
2. `02_Demographic_Cohorts_Cyber_Threat_Landscape.md` (22,100 lines)
3. `04_Generational_Analysis_Attack_Patterns.md` (19,800 lines)
4. `05_Socioeconomic_Stratification_Threat_Actors.md` (21,300 lines)
5. `06_Cultural_Evolution_Cyber_Norms.md` (20,600 lines)

**Rationale:**
- 102,300 total lines provide sufficient population-level data
- Files cover demographic, generational, socioeconomic, and cultural dimensions
- Training data verified to exist in AEON_Training_data_NER10 directory
- Scope manageable for 8-week timeline with 10-agent swarm

**Files Excluded:**
- `03_*` files (likely individual-level analysis - covered by Enhancement 10)
- Redundant demographic files (avoid duplication)

**Impact:** Medium - Defines data ingestion scope and timeline

---

### Decision 003: McKenney Q5/Q7/Q8 Focus
**Date:** 2025-11-25
**Decision Maker:** Threat Intelligence Requirements
**Questions Prioritized:**
- **Q5**: What population biases exist in our threat model?
- **Q7**: How will populations react to large-scale breaches?
- **Q8**: What awareness campaigns work for which demographics?

**Rationale:**
- Q5/Q7/Q8 are population-level questions (perfect fit for psychohistory)
- Q1-Q4, Q6, Q9-Q10 focus on assets, vulnerabilities, controls (covered by other enhancements)
- Prioritization aligns with defensive cybersecurity strategy (awareness, response planning)

**Impact:** High - Defines query interface requirements and success metrics

---

### Decision 004: 10-Agent Swarm Architecture
**Date:** 2025-11-25
**Decision Maker:** TASKMASTER Orchestration Team
**Agent Assignments:**
- 1 coordinator (Asimov persona)
- 5 file specialists (one per training file)
- 1 crisis historian (Seldon Crisis events)
- 1 predictive modeler (mathematical implementations)
- 1 query architect (McKenney interfaces)
- 1 validation tester (historical accuracy)

**Rationale:**
- Parallel file processing (5 agents) enables 2-week ingestion timeline
- Specialist agents ensure domain expertise (generational, cultural, socioeconomic)
- Coordinator prevents duplication and maintains Asimov axiom compliance
- Validator ensures >85% historical accuracy requirement

**Alternatives Considered:**
- 5 agents (slower, 4-week ingestion)
- 15 agents (coordination overhead, diminishing returns)

**Impact:** High - Defines project structure and timeline feasibility

## ISSUE TRACKER

### Issue 001: The Mule Problem (Open)
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Theoretical Limitation
**Description:** Asimov's psychohistory fails for unpredictable individuals (The Mule). Cyber analog: zero-day exploits, insider threats, novel threat actors.

**Impact:**
- Model cannot predict zero-day discovery timing
- Individual insider threat psychology not covered
- Breakthrough offensive techniques (e.g., Stuxnet) are "Mule events"

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Document model limitations in all outputs
- Combine with Enhancement 10 (Psychometric Individual Analysis) for comprehensive coverage
- Use psychohistory for campaign-level predictions, not individual attack forecasting
- Implement uncertainty flags for high-Mule-risk scenarios

**Status:** Acknowledged, mitigation planned

---

### Issue 002: Ethical Concerns - Demographic Profiling (Open)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Category:** Ethical Risk
**Description:** Population-level modeling could enable discriminatory targeting or manipulation if misused.

**Concerns:**
- Demographic stereotyping ("All Boomers are vulnerable")
- Weaponization for offensive operations (mass manipulation campaigns)
- Privacy violations (population tracking without consent)
- Cultural insensitivity (Western-centric norms)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Defensive use only (enhance awareness, not offensive operations)
- Ethical review board oversight for all deployments
- Avoid deterministic labeling (use probabilistic language: "68% likelihood")
- Cultural sensitivity audits by diverse consultation teams
- Transparent documentation of model assumptions and biases

**Status:** Mitigation plan implemented, ongoing monitoring required

---

### Issue 003: Training Data Bias (Open)
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Data Quality
**Description:** Training data may reflect Western-centric perspectives, outdated cultural norms, or demographic assumptions.

**Potential Biases:**
- US/European focus (underrepresentation of Asia, Africa, Latin America)
- 2020-2024 temporal window (pandemic-era behaviors may not generalize)
- English language sources (linguistic and cultural bias)
- Academic/technical author perspectives (not representative of general population)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Cross-reference with global data sources (World Bank, OECD, Pew Research)
- Regular updates as cultural norms evolve (annual refresh cycle)
- Flag high-uncertainty predictions with confidence intervals
- Seek diverse cultural consultation for global deployments
- Explicitly document data provenance and limitations

**Status:** Acknowledged, cross-referencing planned for Phase 4

---

### Issue 004: Computational Complexity (Open)
**Priority:** LOW
**Category:** Performance
**Description:** Population-level queries may be slow on large graphs (millions of nodes, billions of relationships).

**Performance Concerns:**
- Complex Cypher queries with multiple MATCH clauses
- Aggregations over large population cohorts (e.g., "all US Millennials")
- Real-time prediction calculations (Bayesian inference)
- Dashboard refresh latency for analysts

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Neo4j index optimization (age_range, sector, region attributes)
- Query result caching for common demographic patterns
- Pre-computed aggregations for dashboard views
- Parallel query execution using Neo4j clustering (if needed)
- Incremental model updates (not full graph recalculation)

**Status:** Performance testing scheduled for Phase 3, optimization deferred until bottlenecks identified
