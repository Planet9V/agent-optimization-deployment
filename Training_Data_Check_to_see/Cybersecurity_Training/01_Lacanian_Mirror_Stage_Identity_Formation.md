# Lacanian Mirror Stage and Identity Formation in Cybersecurity

## Overview
This file explores Lacan's mirror stage theory and its application to understanding identity formation, ego construction, and self-perception in organizational security contexts.

## Application to Insider Threat Assessment

Mirror stage analysis reveals how identity formation dynamics create security vulnerabilities through:
