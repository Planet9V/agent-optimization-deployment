# Symptom and Sinthome Analysis in Insider Behaviors

## Overview
This file explores Lacanian concepts of symptom (compromised formation encoding unconscious truth), sinthome (personal jouissance crystallization stabilizing psychic structure), and their applications to understanding repetitive insider threat behaviors. Symptoms encode messages requiring interpretation, while sinthomes represent unique ways subjects organize enjoyment.

## Application to Insider Threat Assessment

Symptom and sinthome analysis reveals security implications through:
1. Repetitive violations as symptoms encoding unconscious messages
2. Idiosyncratic practices as sinthomes stabilizing psychic structure
3. Need to distinguish pathological symptoms from necessary sinthomes
4. Symptom interpretation enabling behavioral change
5. Sinthome acceptance as endpoint rather than elimination
6. Social symptoms expressing organizational unconscious truths
