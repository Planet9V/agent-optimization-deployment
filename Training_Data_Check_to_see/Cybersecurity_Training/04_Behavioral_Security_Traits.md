## Personality-Based Security Controls

Organizations can leverage understanding of PERSONALITY_TRAIT patterns to implement targeted SECURITY_CONTROL including behavioral monitoring for high-risk traits and cultural interventions for security-negative characteristics.

Conversely, PERSONALITY_TRAIT patterns of **conscientiousness**, **vigilance**, and **learning orientation** suggest individuals suitable for security champion and peer influence roles.
