# Representativeness Heuristic in Threat Classification

**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** judges probability by similarity to stereotypes, ignoring base rates and sample size.

## Classification Errors
- **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** classifies attacks by resemblance to APT patterns despite low APT base rate
- Incidents matching **<SOCIAL_ENGINEERING>ransomware</SOCIAL_ENGINEERING>** stereotype over-classified as ransomware
- **<INSIDER_INDICATOR>unusual_behavior</INSIDER_INDICATOR>** matching insider threat stereotypes over-investigated through **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>**
- **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>stereotyping</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** analysts rely heavily on **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>**
- User behavior matching **<SOCIAL_ENGINEERING>victim_profile</SOCIAL_ENGINEERING>** stereotype triggers excessive monitoring
- **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** ignores that similar-looking incidents have different causes
- Attack tools matching sophisticated threat actor profiles inflate threat assessment via **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>**
- **<INSIDER_INDICATOR>access_patterns</INSIDER_INDICATOR>** resembling data theft stereotype trigger false investigations
- **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** combines with **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** causing systematic misassessment
- Vulnerability exploitation matching zero-day stereotype gets emergency response despite patch availability
- **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>intuitive</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** decision-makers over-rely on **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>**
- Network traffic matching C2 communication stereotype escalated despite legitimate alternative explanations
- **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** causes **<INSIDER_INDICATOR>profiling_bias</INSIDER_INDICATOR>** in insider threat detection
- Employees matching disgruntled worker stereotype receive disproportionate scrutiny through **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>**
- Alert patterns matching breach indicators stereotype over-weighted despite context
- **<SOCIAL_ENGINEERING>phishing</SOCIAL_ENGINEERING>** emails matching stereotype detected while novel approaches bypass
- **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** prevents recognition of attack variation from stereotypes
- Threat actors matching nation-state profile attributed incorrectly via **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>**
- **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>pattern_matching</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** personnel exhibit strong **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>**
- Security incidents matching "typical breach" stereotype receive standard response despite unique characteristics
- **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** creates tunnel vision matching observed evidence to familiar patterns
- Vulnerability scanners findings matching "critical infrastructure" stereotype prioritized incorrectly
- **<INSIDER_INDICATOR>financial_stress</INSIDER_INDICATOR>** matching embezzlement stereotype triggers investigation despite statistical rarity
- **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** prevents considering alternative hypotheses that don't match stereotypes
- Risk assessments biased by **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>**: "looks like high risk" vs statistical analysis
- **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>assumptions_driven</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** analysts make classification errors through **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>**
- Third-party vendors matching "risky vendor" stereotype receive disproportionate scrutiny
- **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** causes false positives matching threat stereotypes
- Security events matching "normal activity" stereotype dismissed despite contextual anomalies
- **<INSIDER_INDICATOR>policy_violations</INSIDER_INDICATOR>** matching "minor infraction" stereotype under-investigated
- **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** in threat modeling: threats matching known attack patterns overweighted
- User accounts matching "privileged user" stereotype monitored excessively regardless of actual risk
- **<SOCIAL_ENGINEERING>pretext_ing</SOCIAL_ENGINEERING>** attempts matching stereotypical approaches detected while novel methods succeed
- **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>categorical_thinker</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** individuals demonstrate maximum **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** reliance
- Penetration test findings matching "exploitable weakness" stereotype prioritized over higher-risk non-stereotypical findings
- **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** prevents recognizing that small samples don't represent populations
- Contractor behavior matching "untrusted outsider" stereotype creates **<INSIDER_INDICATOR>discriminatory_monitoring</INSIDER_INDICATOR>**
- **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** causes conjunction fallacy: detailed matching scenarios seem more probable
- Security tool alerts matching "true positive" stereotype trusted despite high false positive rates
- **<INSIDER_INDICATOR>after_hours_access</INSIDER_INDICATOR>** matching suspicious behavior stereotype investigated despite legitimate explanations
- **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** in forensic analysis: evidence matching hypothesis stereotype accepted prematurely
- Threat intelligence matching "credible source" stereotype accepted without verification through **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>**

## Countering Strategies
- Statistical training reduces **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** over-reliance
- **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>analytical</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** reviewers check representativeness judgments against base rates
- Mandatory base rate consideration prevents **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** errors
- Sample size awareness counters **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** small sample stereotyping
- Alternative hypothesis generation prevents **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** tunnel vision
- **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>skeptical</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** analysts question stereotype-driven classifications
- Quantitative risk scoring reduces **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** subjective pattern matching
