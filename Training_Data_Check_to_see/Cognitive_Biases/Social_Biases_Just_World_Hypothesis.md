# Just-World Hypothesis - Victim Blaming and Responsibility Training

## Overview
Just-world hypothesis is the cognitive bias that people get what they deserve - good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people. In cybersecurity, this creates victim-blaming culture, reduces empathy for breach victims, and enables security fatalism that undermines security improvement efforts.

## Core Manifestations

### 1. Breach Victim Blaming
<COGNITIVE_BIAS category="attribution_bias" severity="critical" exploitation_vector="victim_responsibility_assumption">
When organizations experience breaches, just-world thinking leads to assumptions that they "must have done something wrong" rather than recognizing sophisticated attack capabilities, reducing organizational willingness to report incidents.

</COGNITIVE_BIAS>

### 2. Phishing Victim Blame
<COGNITIVE_BIAS category="user_responsibility" severity="high" exploitation_vector="training_failure_deflection">
Employees who fall for phishing attacks perceived as deserving consequences due to "lack of awareness," masking organizational training and technical control failures.

## Training Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Phishing Victim Blame
Employee falls for sophisticated spear-phishing attack designed using extensive social media reconnaissance. Just-world thinking leads to blame: "should have been more careful" rather than recognizing attack sophistication and need for technical controls. Employee becomes reluctant to report future suspicious emails due to shame.

### Scenario 2: Supply Chain Breach Response
Organization experiences breach through compromised third-party vendor. Just-world bias leads executives to blame vendor selection team rather than recognizing vendor assessment limitations. Blame culture causes vendor risk team to become overly conservative, rejecting legitimate partnerships.

### Scenario 3: Zero-Day Exploitation
Critical zero-day vulnerability exploited before patch availability. Just-world thinking leads auditors to cite "inadequate defense-in-depth" despite reasonable security controls. Organization develops unrealistic security expectations and excessive control spending on diminishing returns.

### Scenario 4: User Error Attribution
System breach occurs due to complex interaction between configuration error, vendor undocumented behavior, and timing coincidence. Just-world bias focuses blame on individual who made configuration change rather than examining systemic factors. Individual fears reporting future issues.

### Scenario 5: Regulatory Penalty Response
Organization receives regulatory penalty after breach disclosure. Just-world assumption that "penalties prove negligence" damages reputation despite organization having above-average security program and cooperative disclosure. Industry peers avoid information sharing to prevent similar judgment.
