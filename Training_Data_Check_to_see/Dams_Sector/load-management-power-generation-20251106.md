## Hydropower Generation Optimization

### Economic Dispatch Operations
**Real-Time Generation Scheduling**: The OPERATION real-time economic dispatch at Grand Coulee Dam (Third Powerplant with 6 units, EQUIPMENT Unit-G19 through Unit-G24, VENDOR Alstom turbines, 600-800 MW capacity each, total capability 4,215 MW) managed by Power_Dispatcher uses VENDOR ABB EQUIPMENT Energy Management System executing OPERATION security-constrained economic dispatch algorithm optimizing OPERATION hourly generation schedule based on VENDOR California_ISO EQUIPMENT day-ahead market prices (on-peak $55/MWh, off-peak $28/MWh, super-peak $85/MWh). The OPERATION unit commitment decision incorporates OPERATION hydraulic constraints: OPERATION maximum powerhouse discharge 195,000 cfs (limited by EQUIPMENT draft tube submergence maintaining OPERATION tailwater elevation 950 ft minimum), OPERATION minimum generation 240 MW total (four units minimum online preventing OPERATION tailrace water quality degradation), and OPERATION ramp rate limitation 150 MW per minute (preventing OPERATION draft tube pressure surge and OPERATION downstream flow fluctuations). The OPERATION optimization maximizes OPERATION daily revenue: OPERATION scheduling Unit-G22 and Unit-G24 (800 MW each) during OPERATION super-peak hours 17:00-21:00 generating $10,200/hour revenue, OPERATION base-loading Unit-G19 (600 MW continuous) at 450 MW providing OPERATION regulation reserve capability 150 MW up/down per PROTOCOL NERC-BAL-001 frequency regulation requirements, achieving OPERATION daily energy revenue $2.35 million plus OPERATION ancillary services revenue $145,000 per PROTOCOL Bonneville_Power_Administration financial settlement procedures.

**Multi-Unit Coordination Strategy**: The OPERATION coordinated operation of EQUIPMENT Columbia_River_System includes Generation_Coordinator managing OPERATION cascade optimization: OPERATION upstream storage at Grand_Coulee_Dam (active storage 5.2 million acre-feet) releasing OPERATION 145,000 cfs routed through OPERATION downstream projects (Chief_Joseph 2,620 MW, Wells 840 MW, Rocky_Reach 1,287 MW, Rock_Island 660 MW, Wanapum 1,038 MW, Priest_Rapids 956 MW) with OPERATION water travel time 48 hours Grand_Coulee to Priest_Rapids requiring OPERATION 48-hour ahead generation forecast. The OPERATION coordination uses VENDOR HDR EQUIPMENT HEC-ResSim optimization model calculating OPERATION peak efficiency operating points: EQUIPMENT Chief_Joseph Unit-17 peak efficiency 94.8% at 145 MW (72% capacity), EQUIPMENT Wells Unit-8 peak efficiency 95.2% at 105 MW (88% capacity), coordinating OPERATION release timing such that OPERATION downstream projects operate within ±5% of OPERATION peak efficiency points maximizing OPERATION system-wide energy extraction from OPERATION water resource. The OPERATION weekly planning incorporates OPERATION NOAA EQUIPMENT 10-day streamflow forecast (predicted inflow 185,000 cfs rising to 220,000 cfs mid-week), OPERATION irrigation withdrawal schedule (Columbia_Basin_Project withdrawing 8,500 cfs during growing season), and OPERATION fish passage flow requirements (PROTOCOL minimum 120,000 cfs April-August per NOAA_Fisheries Biological Opinion) balancing OPERATION power generation 1,850 average MW with OPERATION treaty obligations and OPERATION environmental constraints per PROTOCOL Columbia_River_Treaty operating plan.

### Frequency Regulation Services
**Automatic Generation Control**: The OPERATION participation in VENDOR Bonneville_Power_Administration EQUIPMENT Automatic Generation Control (AGC) program by Grand_Coulee EQUIPMENT Unit-G19 (rated 600 MW, configured 450 MW base load + 150 MW regulation range) uses VENDOR Woodward EQUIPMENT 505E digital governor receiving OPERATION AGC signal via VENDOR SEL EQUIPMENT Real-Time Automation Controller (four-second update rate, PROTOCOL ICCP protocol communication with VENDOR BPA control center) adjusting OPERATION wicket gate position maintaining OPERATION 60.00 Hz ±0.036 Hz frequency deadband per PROTOCOL NERC-BAL-001-2 frequency control standard. The OPERATION regulation response includes Governor_Engineer configuring OPERATION permanent droop 5% (frequency change 0.05 Hz produces OPERATION 300 MW output change from 150 MW regulation range), OPERATION temporary droop 0% during OPERATION first 500 milliseconds providing OPERATION maximum inertial response, and OPERATION ramping limit 30 MW/minute preventing OPERATION excessive flow variations in EQUIPMENT draft tube. The OPERATION performance validation tests OPERATION step response: OPERATION 50 MW up-regulation command achieving 90% response within 8 seconds, OPERATION 50 MW down-regulation achieving 90% response within 6 seconds (down-regulation faster due to OPERATION wicket gate closing speed), meeting PROTOCOL NERC-BAL-001 regulation accuracy requirement >95% within target range ±15 MW and OPERATION response time requirement <10 seconds. The OPERATION annual regulation revenue totals $1.85 million based on OPERATION capacity payment $12,500/MW-month (150 MW regulation capability × 12 months) plus OPERATION energy payment compensating OPERATION efficiency losses from OPERATION part-load operation estimated $125,000 annually per PROTOCOL BPA regulation service tariff.

**Load Following Operations**: The OPERATION load following service at Dworshak Dam EQUIPMENT Units-1, 2, and 3 (VENDOR Alstom Francis turbines, 135 MW each, 405 MW total capability) provides OPERATION ramping capability 180 MW/hour following OPERATION daily load curve: OPERATION morning ramp-up 06:00-10:00 increasing OPERATION generation from 135 MW (one unit base-loaded) to 405 MW (three units full load) matching OPERATION regional load increase 6,500 MW to 8,200 MW (26% increase), OPERATION mid-day plateau 10:00-17:00 maintaining OPERATION three-unit operation 380-405 MW providing OPERATION maximum capacity during OPERATION peak electricity price period, and OPERATION evening ramp-down 21:00-01:00 reducing OPERATION generation to 135 MW as OPERATION regional load decreases to 5,800 MW. The OPERATION dispatch coordination includes Hydro_Scheduler managing OPERATION reservoir elevation constraints: OPERATION maximum elevation 1,600 ft (flood control rule curve April-July limiting OPERATION storage 3.5 million acre-feet), OPERATION minimum generation elevation 1,520 ft (maintaining OPERATION minimum head 420 ft for OPERATION turbine efficiency >88%), and OPERATION end-of-month elevation targets meeting PROTOCOL Corps_of_Engineers water control manual balancing OPERATION power generation with OPERATION flood control and OPERATION fish passage requirements. The OPERATION generation flexibility provides OPERATION capacity value $8.75/kW-month (405 MW capability generating $425,000 monthly capacity revenue) plus OPERATION energy arbitrage profit: purchasing OPERATION off-peak energy equivalent (storing water during low-price periods) at $25/MWh average, generating during OPERATION on-peak periods at $62/MWh average, yielding OPERATION monthly arbitrage value $1.2 million for OPERATION 32,500 MWh monthly energy generation per PROTOCOL Bonneville_Power_Administration financial accounting.

## Reservoir Water Management

### Flood Control Release Operations
**Controlled Release Scheduling**: The OPERATION flood control operation at Libby Dam during spring runoff implements PROTOCOL Corps_of_Engineers flood control rule curve: OPERATION winter pool elevation 2,287 ft (December-March, storage 2.59 million acre-feet), OPERATION evacuation to elevation 2,259 ft by April 30 (creating OPERATION 1.29 million acre-feet flood storage space), and OPERATION refill to elevation 2,459 ft by July 31 (conservation pool 5.81 million acre-feet) managing OPERATION Kootenai_River flows at Bonners_Ferry Idaho (110 km downstream) limiting OPERATION peak discharge to 50,000 cfs (non-damaging flow per PROTOCOL FEMA flood insurance study). The River_Operations_Engineer coordinates OPERATION release schedule: OPERATION ramping from 12,000 cfs to 45,000 cfs over 10-day period (April 10-20, ramp rate 3,300 cfs per day preventing OPERATION downstream erosion), OPERATION maintaining plateau release 42,000-48,000 cfs for 30 days (April 20-May 20 passing OPERATION forecasted runoff volume 2.8 million acre-feet), and OPERATION ramping down to 20,000 cfs (May 20-31) as OPERATION inflow recession begins per OPERATION NOAA Northwest River Forecast Center streamflow forecast updated daily incorporating OPERATION SNOTEL measurements (snowpack water equivalent 34 inches, 145% of normal, 18 measurement stations in Kootenai_River basin).

**Downstream Flow Management**: The OPERATION downstream impact mitigation during OPERATION flood control releases includes Environmental_Coordinator implementing OPERATION erosion protection monitoring: deploying VENDOR YSI EQUIPMENT 6600V2 multiparameter sondes at five downstream locations measuring OPERATION suspended sediment concentration (turbidity proxy, specification <50 NTU protecting OPERATION fish spawning substrate), OPERATION dissolved oxygen >7.0 mg/L maintaining OPERATION aquatic habitat quality, and OPERATION water temperature <16°C protecting OPERATION bull trout thermal refugia per PROTOCOL US_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service bull trout recovery plan. The OPERATION ramping rate compliance uses EQUIPMENT USGS stream gauge 12310100 (Kootenai_River at Leonia Idaho, 18 km below dam, VENDOR Campbell_Scientific EQUIPMENT CS-451 pressure transducer, 15-minute recording interval) verifying OPERATION stage rate-of-change <1.0 ft/hour during OPERATION power generation load-following operations preventing OPERATION fish stranding in OPERATION side channels and OPERATION backwater sloughs. The OPERATION coordination with VENDOR Bonneville_Power_Administration incorporates OPERATION power generation value loss: OPERATION spilling 5,000 cfs through EQUIPMENT drum gates (bypassing OPERATION powerhouse discharge 30,000 cfs through four turbines) reducing OPERATION generation 40 MW (valued $2,200/hour at $55/MWh on-peak price) justified by OPERATION dissolved gas management maintaining OPERATION total dissolved gas <110% saturation measured at EQUIPMENT tailrace monitor (VENDOR Point_Four EQUIPMENT Tracker gas tension monitor, accuracy ±0.5% saturation) per PROTOCOL Oregon_DEQ water quality standard protecting OPERATION downstream aquatic life from OPERATION gas bubble disease.

### Multi-Purpose Water Supply Operations
**Municipal Water Release Coordination**: The OPERATION water supply delivery from Folsom Dam to VENDOR Sacramento_County_Water_Agency implements PROTOCOL water rights permit: OPERATION delivering 245,000 acre-feet annually (average 338 cfs continuous) through EQUIPMENT Folsom_South_Canal (capacity 630 cfs, concrete-lined canal, 14-mile length to Alder_Creek Diversion) serving OPERATION municipal and industrial demand for 620,000 customers in Sacramento_area. The Water_Operations_Manager coordinates OPERATION release schedule balancing OPERATION drinking water supply (OPERATION summer peak demand 520 cfs serving OPERATION landscape irrigation and OPERATION residential use) against OPERATION power generation optimal flow (EQUIPMENT Unit-5 peak efficiency 94.2% at 8,500 cfs, total powerhouse optimal discharge 42,500 cfs through five units) and OPERATION American_River minimum flow requirement (PROTOCOL NOAA_Fisheries biological opinion requiring OPERATION 1,250 cfs minimum October-March, 2,000 cfs minimum April-September supporting OPERATION fall-run Chinook salmon spawning and OPERATION steelhead rearing).
