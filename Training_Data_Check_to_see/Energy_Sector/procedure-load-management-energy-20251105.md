# Load Management Procedures

## Peak Load Response Procedures

### High Demand Activation Protocol
**Initiation Trigger**: When System_Load_Actual exceeds 4,650 MW (95% of System_Capacity_Total 4,900 MW), the Load_Forecast_Coordinator activates Peak_Demand_Protocol-PDP-2024 through Siemens Spectrum-Power energy management system. Operator_Senior monitors Generator_Unit_CT-556 startup (GE LM6000-PF aeroderivative, 47 MW, 10-minute start time) via GE Mark-VI turbine control responding to dispatch signal from ABB Network-Manager SCADA. The Control_Center_Regional coordinates Generator_Unit_CT-778 (Solar Turbines Taurus-70, 8.9 MW) startup sequence with Field_Operator validating fuel gas pressure 345 psig at Compressor_Station_North supplying Generator_Fuel_System.

**Generation Sequencing**: Dispatch_Engineer brings Generator_Unit_GT-445 (Siemens SGT-750 turbine, 38 MW) online following 8-minute purge cycle monitored through Emerson Ovation-3.5 control system reading exhaust temperature 520°F during startup. The Generator_Operator synchronizes Generator_Unit_GT-445 to Station_Bus_13.8kV using Beckwith-M-3425 synchronizer verifying voltage match within 3% (13.39-13.39 kV measured), frequency within 0.1 Hz (59.95-60.05 Hz), and phase angle within 8° before GE PowerVac-15 generator breaker closure. System_Operator validates generator loading ramp 2 MW/minute using OSI PI trending showing Generator_Unit_GT-445 reaching 34 MW output after 17-minute loading period.

### Emergency Generation Dispatch
**Fast-Start Unit Activation**: Critical system conditions (frequency below 59.7 Hz measured by SEL-751 relay or voltage below 0.95 pu at Substation_Metro) trigger automatic start of Generator_Unit_DS-889 (diesel standby, Caterpillar 3516C, 2.5 MW) through ASCO-7000 automatic transfer switch control. The Station_Operator confirms Generator_Unit_DS-889 achieves rated voltage 4,160V within 10-second start requirement measured by Schweitzer SEL-710 motor protection relay. Emergency_Coordinator dispatches Generator_Unit_GT-223 (Pratt-Whitney FT-8 SwiftPac, 26 MW, 15-minute online time) for sustained emergency support while monitoring combustor pressure 189 psig via Woodward MicroNet-TMR control.

**Load Shedding Coordination**: If emergency generation insufficient, Operator_Load_Management executes Under-Frequency Load Shedding scheme UFLS-2024-A through SEL-2411 programmable controllers at 8 distribution substations. The automated scheme drops Distribution_Feeder_45A (12.47 kV, 8.9 MW load) at 59.3 Hz threshold, Distribution_Feeder_67B (34.5 kV, 12.3 MW load) at 59.1 Hz, and Distribution_Feeder_89C (12.47 kV, 6.7 MW load) at 58.9 Hz measured by individual SEL-751 feeder relays. System_Operator monitors frequency recovery through Arbiter-1094B GPS-synchronized clock expecting system restoration above 59.8 Hz within 30 seconds of final load shed step.

## Demand Response Programs

### Industrial Curtailment Execution
**Interruptible Service Activation**: The Demand_Response_Manager sends curtailment signal through OSI Monarch Energy-Management to Customer_Manufacturing_Alpha (contracted load reduction 67 MW) via Siemens SICAM-A8000 RTU using DNP3.0 protocol. Customer facility reduces Load_Process_Furnace_1 (electric arc furnace, ABB ACS-6000 drive, 34 MW) and Load_Process_Mill_3 (grinding mill, 18 MW Siemens medium voltage drive) achieving total curtailment 52 MW within 15-minute notification period. The GE MDS-PulseNET radio system confirms curtailment through Landis+Gyr-S650 interval meter (15-minute demand intervals, accuracy ±0.2%) showing load reduction from baseline 89 MW to 37 MW.

**Residential Demand Response**: Smart thermostat program activates through Itron-Riva platform sending control signals to enrolled Customer_Residential_Pool (45,000 programmable thermostats, ecobee Smart-Thermostat-Enhanced) implementing 2°F setpoint adjustment during Peak_Event_Critical. The Demand_Analyst validates aggregate load reduction 28 MW using AMI data from Landis+Gyr-Gridstream electric meters deployed across Service_Territory_Metro. Residential_Program_Manager coordinates Water_Heater_Control through Steffes-ETS water heater load controllers (Grid-Friendly Appliance enabled) providing additional 8.9 MW demand flexibility during 4-hour peak window 14:00-18:00 hours.

### Commercial Load Management
**HVAC Curtailment Protocol**: Building automation systems at Customer_Commercial_Office_Tower (12 office buildings, 890,000 sq ft total) receive OpenADR-2.0b signals from GridPoint DemandSmart-Platform adjusting Carrier AquaEdge-19DV chillers (combined cooling 4,500 tons) and reducing lighting through Lutron-Quantum control panels. The Energy_Manager validates load reduction from baseline 6.7 MW to 4.9 MW (27% curtailment) using Schneider-Electric PowerLogic-8000 power meters installed at main service disconnects rated 4,160V. Curtailment_Coordinator tracks cumulative portfolio response across Commercial_Program_Participants (234 facilities) achieving aggregate reduction 67 MW during System_Emergency_Alert.

**Retail Refrigeration Management**: Grocery_Chain_Network (67 supermarkets) implements refrigeration load cycling through Emerson-E2 controls modulating Copeland-Scroll compressor operation in frozen food cases (total connected load 12.3 MW). The Program_Administrator monitors case temperatures using Emerson Site-Supervisor ensuring frozen products maintain -10°F to 0°F range during 15-minute cycling periods coordinated with peak demand. Customer participation validated through Obvius-AcquiSuite data loggers measuring individual store demand showing Load_Store_456 cycling from 189 kW baseline to 145 kW during curtailment events without compromising product quality per HACCP food safety requirements.

## Generator Startup Procedures

### Combined Cycle Startup Sequence
**Gas Turbine Start Protocol**: Generator_Unit_CC-445 (Mitsubishi M501GAC gas turbine, 334 MW) initiates startup through GE Mark-VIe control system beginning purge cycle (5-minute duration, exhaust damper open, turning gear 3 rpm). The Unit_Operator monitors Fuel_Gas_Compressor_FGC-7 (Solar Centaur-50, 4,000 hp) delivering fuel pressure 445 psig to turbine fuel manifold measured by Rosemount-3051 pressure transmitters. Turbine acceleration proceeds through cranking speed 630 rpm using starting motor (3,000 hp Siemens induction motor) until self-sustaining speed 3,600 rpm (synchronous speed for 60 Hz generation) achieved at 15-minute mark validated by Bently-Nevada 3500/42 speed monitors.

**Steam Turbine Integration**: Following gas turbine base load achievement (334 MW output), Heat_Recovery_Steam_Generator-HRSG-445 (triple-pressure unfired, Babcock-Wilcox design) produces superheated steam 1,800 psig/1,000°F at high-pressure section monitored by Rosemount-3144P temperature transmitters and Yokogawa-EJA530E pressure transmitters. The Steam_Turbine_ST-445 (Siemens SST-600, 189 MW) begins roll at 28-minute mark using turning gear release at 10 rpm progressing through critical speeds 900 rpm and 1,800 rpm before reaching 3,600 rpm synchronous speed at 45-minute elapsed time. Generator_Operator monitors shaft vibration via Bently-Nevada proximity probes ensuring peak vibration below 3.0 mils during acceleration through resonance zones.

### Simple Cycle Startup Operations
**Peaking Unit Fast Start**: Generator_Unit_GT-667 (GE LMS100, 103 MW) executes rapid start sequence achieving full load within 10 minutes for emergency peaking duty. The Operator_Peaking initiates start through GE Mark-VI turbine control monitoring compressor inlet temperature 67°F (ambient) and barometric pressure 29.92 inHg for output correction factors. Turbine accelerates through variable inlet guide vane control reaching self-sustaining speed 3,000 rpm (gas producer section) at 3-minute mark while free power turbine accelerates to 3,600 rpm (generator drive) by 5-minute mark measured by magnetic pickups on turbine shaft.

**Synchronization and Loading**: At 6-minute mark Generator_Unit_GT-667 reaches no-load voltage 13,800V with frequency 60.0 Hz validated by SEL-700G generator protection relay. The Synchronizing_Operator uses Beckwith-M-3310 automatic synchronizer confirming sync-check parameters (voltage magnitude difference <2%, frequency difference <0.05 Hz, phase angle <5°) before closing ABB VD4-40 generator circuit breaker. Generator loading proceeds at maximum ramp rate 15 MW/minute (limited by GE exhaust temperature 950°F limit) achieving full 103 MW output at 10-minute total elapsed time while maintaining turbine speed 3,600 rpm ±0.5 rpm through Woodward-505E governor control.
