## EcoStruxure Grid Platform Architecture

Schneider Electric EcoStruxure Grid delivers IoT-enabled architecture spanning connected products, edge control systems, and analytics applications for electrical distribution networks. The platform integrates protection relays, RTUs, load break switches, and reclosers into unified automation framework communicating via IEC 61850, DNP3, and Modbus protocols. EcoStruxure Grid ADMS (Advanced Distribution Management System) provides supervisory control, outage management system (OMS), and distribution optimization applications serving utilities managing 50,000 to 500,000+ endpoints.

EcoStruxure ADMS implements network model management using MultiSpeak and CIM (IEC 61968/61970) standards for GIS integration and asset information synchronization. Real-time network analysis engines perform load flow calculations, short circuit analysis, and voltage profile assessment using utility network topology and measurement data. FLISR (Fault Location, Isolation, and Service Restoration) algorithms automatically operate remotely-controlled switches and reclosers to isolate faulted sections and restore service to out-of-service customers within 60-120 seconds of fault detection.

EcoStruxure Grid Edge Control layer encompasses SCADA RTUs, protection IEDs, and gateway devices. The architecture supports hierarchical control with local intelligence in field devices executing protection logic, auto-reclosing sequences, and load shedding schemes autonomously while coordinating with centralized ADMS through redundant communication channels. Edge computing capabilities enable distributed volt/VAR optimization (VVO) algorithms running on substation controllers, reducing reactive power losses and regulating voltage within ANSI C84.1 limits without constant communication to control center.

## Easergy Protection Relay Series

Easergy P3 medium voltage protection relay serves distribution feeder, transformer, and motor protection applications up to 36kV. The device integrates four-stage overcurrent protection (50/51), directional earth fault protection (67N/67NC), under/overvoltage elements (27/59), and power quality recording capturing RMS voltage/current, harmonics up to 31st order, and transient waveforms at 256 samples/cycle during disturbance events. Built-in Rogowski coil and low-power VT inputs eliminate conventional CT and VT secondary circuits, reducing panel space and wiring complexity.

Easergy P5 relay family provides numerical protection for transmission, sub-transmission, and distribution systems with configurable protection functions through IEC 61850 engineering tools. Easergy P5x3 distance protection relay implements six independent distance zones with quadrilateral characteristics, three-pole trip and single-pole trip/reclose logic, and power swing blocking using double-blinder schemes. Teleprotection interfaces support direct fiber connections, SDH/SONET multiplexer integration, and pilot wire schemes over leased copper pairs. The relay achieves distance protection operating times under 20ms for Zone 1 faults and coordinates with downstream relays through time-graded Zone 2/3 settings.

Easergy T300 RTU and protection relay combines remote terminal unit functionality with integrated protection elements serving pole-mounted distribution automation applications. The device withstands extended temperature ranges from -40°C to +85°C and operates from solar power with super-capacitor energy storage for load break switch operations during communication loss. T300 implements local volt/VAR control logic using real-time voltage measurements and reactive power calculations, autonomously switching capacitor banks to maintain voltage within ±3% of nominal while minimizing distribution losses.

## PowerSCADA Expert System

PowerSCADA Expert delivers web-based SCADA platform supporting distribution utilities, industrial facilities, and microgrid operators. The system architecture implements n+1 redundant server nodes with automatic failover achieving 99.95% system availability. Each server node processes up to 100,000 data points with 1-2 second refresh cycles, storing time-series data in redundant historian databases with compression algorithms achieving 10:1 storage reduction while maintaining microsecond timestamp accuracy.

PowerSCADA Expert visualization uses HTML5 web clients eliminating thick-client software installation requirements and enabling operator access from tablets and mobile devices. Graphical displays implement ISA-101 HMI design standards with alarm state indication, trend overlays, and one-click access to equipment manuals and single-line diagrams. Situational awareness features include alarm filtering based on network topology, automatic suppression of consequential alarms during cascading events, and integration with geographic information systems (GIS) displaying substation status on aerial imagery.

Advanced SCADA applications include load forecasting using historical demand patterns and weather data integration, equipment maintenance scheduling based on accumulated operating hours and fault counts, and energy accounting calculating line losses and unmetered consumption. The system implements IEC 60870-5-104 and DNP3 outstation simulators for control center operator training and SCADA system acceptance testing without requiring connection to live substation equipment.

## Integration with Distribution Management Systems

Schneider Electric ADMS integrates with PowerSCADA Expert through native IEC 61850 MMS services and CIM-based data exchange adapters. The ADMS network model synchronizes with GIS databases using MultiSpeak Version 5 web services, automatically updating connectivity model when field crews complete switching operations or install new equipment. Real-time SCADA measurements populate network analysis applications including state estimation algorithms that detect and filter bad measurements using weighted least-squares estimation techniques.

ADMS outage management system (OMS) correlates customer calls, smart meter last-gasp notifications, and SCADA alarms to predict outage locations using network topology analysis and historical outage patterns. OMS generates crew dispatch orders with optimized routing considering crew locations, estimated repair times, and customer priority rankings. Integration with automated metering infrastructure (AMI) head-end systems enables remote service restoration verification by polling smart meters after circuit breaker reclosing, confirming customer power restoration without requiring field crew confirmation.

Volt/VAR optimization application operates in near-real-time, analyzing feeder voltages and reactive power flows to determine optimal capacitor bank and voltage regulator positions. The algorithm minimizes I²R losses in distribution feeders while maintaining voltage within ANSI C84.1 Range A limits (114-126V on 120V base). VVO controls coordinate substation load tap changers (LTCs), line voltage regulators, and switched capacitor banks through SCADA commands, achieving 1-3% energy savings for typical distribution circuits.

## Communication Protocol Implementation

Schneider Electric devices support IEC 61850 substation automation protocol with logical node implementations covering protection (PTOC, PDIF, PDIR), control (CSWI, CILO), and measurement (MMXU, MMTR) functions. IEC 61850 engineering workflow uses IEC 61850-6 SCL (System Configuration Language) files for automated device configuration import/export, streamlining commissioning and reducing configuration errors. GOOSE messaging implements fast peer-to-peer communication for interlocking logic and breaker failure protection schemes with typical transmission times under 4ms over ethernet networks.

DNP3 protocol support includes DNP3 Serial and DNP3 over TCP/IP with Secure Authentication Version 5 providing cryptographic integrity verification and session key management. DNP3 implementations support dataset transfer enabling efficient configuration management and firmware updates over communication networks. Binary output commands control circuit breakers and switches, analog setpoint commands adjust voltage regulator tap positions, and file transfer services retrieve relay event records and oscillography waveforms for fault analysis.

Modbus RTU serial and Modbus TCP ethernet protocols provide integration with legacy PLCs, building automation systems, and third-party instruments. IEC 60870-5-101 serial protocol serves European utility markets, while IEC 60870-5-104 TCP/IP variant supports wide-area network communication. Time synchronization implements IRIG-B, SNTP, and IEEE 1588 PTP depending on application timing accuracy requirements, maintaining synchronized timestamps across distributed devices for sequence-of-events analysis and synchrophasor data collection.
