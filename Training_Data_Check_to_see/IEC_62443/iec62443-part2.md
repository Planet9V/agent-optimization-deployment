## 🚀 Advanced Implementation Patterns

### Security Program Automation

#### Automated Risk Assessment
```javascript
// Automated risk assessment workflow
const automatedRiskAssessment = {
  triggers: ['scheduled', 'change', 'incident'],
  assessmentTypes: ['asset', 'threat', 'vulnerability', 'impact'],

  async executeAssessment(trigger, scope) {
    // Gather assessment data
    const assets = await getAssetsInScope(scope);
    const threats = await getCurrentThreats();
    const vulnerabilities = await scanVulnerabilities(assets);

    // Calculate risks
    const risks = [];
    for (const asset of assets) {
      const assetRisks = calculateAssetRisks(asset, threats, vulnerabilities);
      risks.push(...assetRisks);
    }

    // Prioritize and report
    const prioritizedRisks = prioritizeRisks(risks);
    await generateRiskReport(prioritizedRisks);
    await notifyStakeholders(prioritizedRisks);

    return prioritizedRisks;
  }
};
```

#### Automated Compliance Monitoring
```javascript
// Continuous compliance monitoring
const complianceMonitor = {
  standards: ['IEC62443', 'NIST', 'ISO27001'],
  checkFrequency: 'daily',
  alertThresholds: {
    critical: 0,
    high: 5,
    medium: 10
  },

  async monitorCompliance() {
    const complianceStatus = {};

    for (const standard of this.standards) {
      complianceStatus[standard] = await assessCompliance(standard);
    }

    // Check for violations
    const violations = identifyViolations(complianceStatus);

    if (violations.critical.length > 0) {
      await escalateCriticalViolations(violations.critical);
    }

    if (violations.high.length > this.alertThresholds.high) {
      await alertHighViolations(violations.high);
    }

    // Generate compliance report
    await generateComplianceReport(complianceStatus);

    return complianceStatus;
  }
};
```

### Patch Management Automation

#### Intelligent Patch Orchestration
```javascript
// Automated patch orchestration system
const patchOrchestrator = {
  environments: ['development', 'staging', 'production'],
  approvalWorkflows: {
    critical: 'auto-approve',
    high: 'manager-approval',
    medium: 'committee-approval',
    low: 'scheduled'
  },

  async orchestratePatchDeployment(patchInfo) {
    // Assess patch characteristics
    const riskLevel = assessPatchRisk(patchInfo);
    const approvalType = this.approvalWorkflows[riskLevel];

    // Route for approval
    const approval = await getApproval(approvalType, patchInfo);

    if (!approval.granted) {
      await notifyRejection(approval);
      return;
    }

    // Execute deployment pipeline
    for (const env of this.environments) {
      await deployToEnvironment(patchInfo, env);

      // Validate deployment
      const validation = await validateDeployment(patchInfo, env);
      if (!validation.success) {
        await executeRollback(patchInfo, env);
        await notifyFailure(validation);
        break;
      }

      // Wait for stabilization
      await waitForStabilization(env);
    }

    await notifySuccess(patchInfo);
  }
};
```

#### Predictive Patch Management
```javascript
// Predictive patch management using ML
const predictivePatchManager = {
  historicalData: 'patch_deployment_history.json',
  predictionModel: 'patch_success_predictor',

  async predictPatchSuccess(patchInfo) {
    // Load historical data
    const history = await loadHistoricalData();

    // Extract features
    const features = extractPatchFeatures(patchInfo, history);

    // Make prediction
    const prediction = await this.predictionModel.predict(features);

    return {
      successProbability: prediction.probability,
      riskFactors: prediction.riskFactors,
      recommendedActions: prediction.recommendations
    };
  },

  async optimizeDeploymentSchedule(patches) {
    // Consider system dependencies
    const dependencies = analyzeDependencies(patches);

    // Optimize deployment order
    const optimalOrder = optimizeOrder(patches, dependencies);

    // Schedule deployments
    const schedule = generateSchedule(optimalOrder);

    return schedule;
  }
};
```

### Supplier Security Automation

    const auditReports = await getAuditReports(supplierId);
    const incidentHistory = await getIncidentHistory(supplierId);
    const complianceStatus = await checkComplianceStatus(supplierId);

    // Calculate scores
    const scores = {
      policy: evaluatePolicyScore(questionnaire),
      controls: evaluateControlsScore(auditReports),
      incidents: evaluateIncidentScore(incidentHistory),
      compliance: evaluateComplianceScore(complianceStatus),
      improvement: evaluateImprovementScore(auditReports)
    };

    // Calculate overall score
    const overallScore = calculateWeightedScore(scores, this.assessmentCriteria);

    // Generate recommendations
    const recommendations = generateRecommendations(scores);

    return {
      supplierId,
      assessmentDate: new Date(),
      scores,
      overallScore,
      riskLevel: determineRiskLevel(overallScore),

    medium: 5.0
  },

  async monitorSuppliers() {
    const suppliers = await getActiveSuppliers();
    const alerts = [];

    for (const supplier of suppliers) {
      // Check for changes
      const changes = await detectSupplierChanges(supplier.id);

      if (changes.significant) {
        // Reassess supplier
        const reassessment = await reassessSupplier(supplier.id);

        // Check risk level change
        if (reassessment.riskLevel !== supplier.currentRiskLevel) {
          alerts.push({
            supplier: supplier.id,
            type: 'risk_level_change',
            oldLevel: supplier.currentRiskLevel,
            newLevel: reassessment.riskLevel,
            severity: calculateSeverity(reassessment.riskLevel)
          });
        }
      }

      // Check compliance status
      const compliance = await checkSupplierCompliance(supplier.id);
      if (!compliance.current) {
        alerts.push({
          supplier: supplier.id,
          type: 'compliance_violation',
          details: compliance.violations,
          severity: 'high'
