## Total Annotations by Category

| Framework | Files Created | Annotations |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Enneagram | 10 | 1,780 |
| HEXACO | 8 | 1,620 |
| MBTI | 18 | 3,260 |
| Attachment | 6 | 1,260 |
| Narcissism | 3 | 700 |
| Psychopathy | 3 | 700 |
| **TOTAL** | **48** | **9,320** |

## Cross-Framework Integration

Every annotation includes cross-references to:
- **INSIDER_INDICATOR**: Specific insider threat manifestations
- **COGNITIVE_BIAS**: Systematic thinking errors affecting security
- **THREAT_ACTOR**: Threat actor profiles when traits become pathological

Cross-framework correlations established:
- Enneagram ↔ HEXACO (e.g., Type 1 high Conscientiousness)
- Enneagram ↔ MBTI (e.g., Type 5 as INTP/INTJ)
- HEXACO ↔ Attachment (e.g., low H-H correlates with insecure attachment)
- Narcissism ↔ Psychopathy overlap (Factor 1 shared traits)
- All frameworks ↔ Insider threat risk profiles

## Coverage Depth

Each file includes comprehensive analysis:

**Personality Traits**: Core behavioral patterns in security contexts
**Security Roles**: Suitability for different security positions
**Team Dynamics**: Collaboration patterns and conflict areas
**Stress Responses**: Warning signs and crisis behaviors
**Mitigation Strategies**: Management and risk reduction approaches
**Case Studies**: Real-world application examples
**Assessment Methods**: Detection and evaluation techniques
**Development Paths**: Growth and deterioration trajectories

## Behavioral Security Applications

**Insider Threat Assessment**:
- Pre-employment screening indicators
- Ongoing behavioral monitoring flags
- Crisis prediction and early warning systems
- Post-incident psychological profiling

**Security Culture Development**:
- Personality-aware security training
- Team composition optimization
- Leadership style matching
- Communication strategy personalization

**Risk Management**:
- Role-based personality risk scoring
- Access control decision support
- Security policy compliance prediction
- Incident response preparedness

## Quality Assurance

✅ All annotations follow standardized format:
```
**PERSONALITY_TRAIT**: Description of trait in security context
**INSIDER_INDICATOR**: Specific threat manifestation
**COGNITIVE_BIAS**: Associated systematic thinking error
```

✅ Cross-references maintained throughout all frameworks
✅ Security-specific applications for every trait
✅ Evidence-based psychological foundations
✅ Practical organizational applications
