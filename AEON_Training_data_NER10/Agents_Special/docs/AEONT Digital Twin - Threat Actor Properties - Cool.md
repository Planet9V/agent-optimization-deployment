ThreatActor 

  ⎿  ☒ Initialize Phase 4 swarm with mesh topology (Temporal specialists)
     ☒ Spawn specialized agents: CVE-Timeline-Analyst, Attack-Campaign-Reconstructor, Temporal-Decay-Calculator
     ☒ Discovery Phase: Analyze CVE temporal properties, ThreatActor campaigns, Attack timelines
     ☒ Alignment Phase: Validate temporal chain algorithms and decay functions
     ☒ Create Qdrant checkpoint (pre-execution baseline for Phase 4)
     ☒ Execute: CVE Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline (53,536 relationships created)
     ☐ Execute: Attack Campaign Timeline Reconstruction (1,372 relationships)
     ☐ Execute: Temporal Decay Application (42,045 existing relationships)
     ☐ Validation: Test temporal multi-hop queries and verify CVE preservation
     ☐ Create Qdrant checkpoint (post-execution complete for Ph
