# Fine Screens

Fine screens are used when a higher degree of solids removal is required at the preliminary stage, or as a protective measure for sensitive downstream processes like Membrane Bioreactors (MBRs). They are characterized by openings of less than 6 mm and are designed to capture smaller materials like plastic particles, hair, and paper fibers.7 Common types include:
Rotary Drum Screens: These consist of a cylindrical drum, typically made of perforated plate or wedge wire, that rotates in the flow channel. In an internally-fed design, wastewater flows into the drum, and solids are retained on the inner surface as water passes through the screen. The retained solids are then lifted by the drum's rotation and discharged into a trough or conveyor. This configuration is well-suited for high flow rates.6 In an
externally-fed design, wastewater flows around the outside of the drum, and solids are captured on the exterior surface. This type is particularly effective in applications with high concentrations of oil or grease.7
Band Screens: This in-channel solution uses a series of interconnected, perforated panels that form a continuous vertical loop. Wastewater flows through the center of the loop, and solids are captured on the inside of the panels. As the band rotates, it lifts the solids out of the water for removal. The design of the panels, often made from ultra-high-molecular-weight (UHMW) polyethylene, can be optimized to prevent "hair pinning," a common issue where fibrous materials wrap around screen elements and cause clogs.7
Auger Screens (Spiral Screw Screens): This compact equipment combines screening, conveying, and dewatering into a single unit. It features a spiral auger blade rotating inside a perforated tube or trough. Wastewater flows into the unit, and solids are captured by the screen. The rotating auger then conveys the screenings up the tube, dewatering them through compaction before discharging them at a higher elevation.6
