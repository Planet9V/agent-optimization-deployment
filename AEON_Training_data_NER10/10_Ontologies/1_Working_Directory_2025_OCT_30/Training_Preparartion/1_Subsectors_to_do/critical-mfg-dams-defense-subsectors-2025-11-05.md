## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This research provides comprehensive subsector breakdowns for three critical infrastructure sectors as designated by CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency). Research was conducted using official CISA sources, government documentation, and Congressional Research Service reports.

**Key Findings:**
- **Critical Manufacturing:** 4 official subsectors (NAICS-based)
- **Dams:** Classified by function (7+ types) and ownership (5 categories)
- **Defense Industrial Base:** Functional categories rather than traditional subsectors due to security classification

### Regulatory Structure

**State Regulation:** State dam safety offices regulate approximately 71% of National Inventory of Dams (NID)-listed dams

**Federal Role:** Federal government plays key policy role for both federal and non-federal dams through:
- Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) - National Dam Safety Program
- U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - National Inventory of Dams
- Bureau of Reclamation - Federal dam operations

**CISA Role:** Sector Risk Management Agency for critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity

## CONCLUSION

This research successfully identified and documented the subsector structures for all three critical infrastructure sectors:

1. **Critical Manufacturing** uses a clear 4-subsector model based on NAICS industrial classifications
2. **Dams** uses a functional and ownership-based classification system rather than traditional subsectors
3. **Defense Industrial Base** organizes by functional categories with significant classified information limitations

All three sectors represent critical national infrastructure with unique organizational structures reflecting their distinct operational requirements and security considerations.
