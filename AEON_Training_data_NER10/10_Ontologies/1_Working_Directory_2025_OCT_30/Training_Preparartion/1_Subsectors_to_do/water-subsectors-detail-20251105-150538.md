## SUBSECTOR 1: DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS

### Overview
- **Total Systems:** Approximately 152,000 public drinking water systems
- **Population Served:** Over 80% of U.S. population
- **Primary Function:** Supply safe drinking water for human consumption

### Official System Classifications (EPA)

The EPA classifies public water systems into THREE types based on:
- Number of people served
- Source of water
- Whether they serve same customers year-round or occasionally

#### 1.1 Community Water System (CWS)
**Definition:** Public water system that supplies water to the same population year-round

**Characteristics:**
- Serves residential customers
- Year-round operation
- Consistent customer base
- **Number:** ~50,000 community water systems in U.S.

**Examples:**
- Municipal water utilities
- Mobile home parks
- Apartment complexes with own wells

#### 1.2 Non-Transient Non-Community Water System (NTNCWS)
**Definition:** Public water system that regularly supplies water to at least 25 of the same people at least six months per year (but not year-round)

**Characteristics:**
- Serves same individuals regularly
- Non-residential setting
- Minimum 6 months/year operation
- Serves 25+ same people

**Examples:**
- Schools with own water systems
- Factories
- Office buildings
- Hospitals with dedicated water supply

#### 1.3 Transient Non-Community Water System (TNCWS)
**Definition:** Public water system that provides water where people do not remain for long periods

**Characteristics:**
- Serves different people daily
- Temporary/transient population
- 25+ people per day minimum
- Minimum 60 days per year operation

**Examples:**
- Gas stations
- Campgrounds

### Drinking Water Infrastructure Components

#### Treatment Facilities
**Function:** Process raw water to meet EPA drinking water standards

**Key Treatment Processes:**

- Corrosion control

**Quality Assurance:**
Sanitary surveys evaluate EIGHT areas:
1. Water sources
2. Treatment processes
3. Distribution systems
4. Finished water storage
5. Pumps, pump systems, and controls
6. Monitoring, reporting, and data verification
7. Water system management and operations
8. Operator compliance with requirements

#### Distribution Systems

- **Pumps:** Pressure maintenance and flow regulation

**Distribution Network Infrastructure:**
- Ground level tanks
- Elevated tanks (steel tanks and standpipes)
- Below-ground reservoirs
- Partially below-ground storage
- Above-ground storage with pump stations

#### Finished Water Storage
**Types:**
- Elevated storage tanks
- Ground-level tanks
- Underground reservoirs
- Standpipes

**Functions:**
- Supply peak demand flow rates
- Equalize system pressures

- Maintain positive pressure (prevent contamination)

**Design Considerations:**
- Elevated storage reduces pumping requirements
- More economical than ground storage
- Maintains system pressure during pump outages
- Critical for contamination prevention

#### Pumping Stations
**Functions:**

- Distribute treated water throughout network
- Boost pressure in elevated areas

**EPA Tools:**
EPANET software for:
- Designing and sizing new infrastructure
- Retrofitting aging infrastructure
- Optimizing tank and pump operations

- **Manholes:** Access points for maintenance

**Coverage:**
- 1.9 million miles of collection piping
- Serves residential, commercial, and industrial customers
- Gravity-fed and pump-assisted systems

**Note:** Collection systems are considered part of treatment works ONLY if they carry wastewater to a POTW facility

#### Treatment Facilities (POTWs)
**Function:** Treat and process wastewater before discharge

**Facility Types by Size:**
- Small systems (serving <10,000 people)
- Medium systems (serving 10,000-100,000 people)
- Large systems (serving >100,000 people)

**Treatment Levels:**
- **Primary Treatment:** Physical removal of solids
- **Secondary Treatment:** Biological treatment processes
- **Advanced Treatment:** Additional nutrient removal, disinfection

- Water reuse/recycling systems

#### Pumping and Conveyance
**Components:**
- Lift stations
