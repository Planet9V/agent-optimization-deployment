## Executive Summary

The Energy Sector, designated as one of 16 critical infrastructure sectors under Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21), is organized into **TWO (2) primary subsectors** according to official DOE and CISA documentation:

1. **Electricity Subsector**
2. **Oil and Natural Gas Subsector** (Combined)

However, within each primary subsector exist detailed functional components and systems that form the operational infrastructure.

## High-Level Subsector Organization

### Official Subsector Count: **2 Primary Subsectors**

1. **Electricity Subsector**
2. **Oil and Natural Gas Subsector**

**Note:** While some industry documentation references "electricity, oil, and natural gas" as three segments, official DOE/CISA documentation combines oil and natural gas into a single unified subsector for critical infrastructure protection purposes.

## Critical Infrastructure Context

### Sector-Specific Agency (SSA)
**U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)** serves as the lead federal agency responsible for coordinating critical infrastructure protection for the Energy Sector.

### Coordinating Councils
- **Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council (ESCC):** Represents private sector electricity interests
- **Oil and Natural Gas Subsector Coordinating Council (ONG SCC):** Represents private sector oil and gas interests
- **Energy Government Coordinating Council (GCC):** Represents federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal government interests

### Unique Critical Infrastructure Designation
Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21) identifies the Energy Sector as uniquely critical because it provides an **"enabling function"** across all 16 critical infrastructure sectors. Virtually all industries and critical infrastructure depend on:
- Electricity for operations
- Petroleum products for transportation and industrial processes
- Natural gas for heating, electricity generation, and industrial applications

### Private Sector Ownership
More than 80% of energy infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector, making public-private coordination essential for security and resilience.
