# Symbolic Order and Organizational Culture in Cybersecurity

## Overview
This file explores Lacan's concept of the symbolic order—the realm of language, law, and social structure—and its application to understanding organizational culture, policy frameworks, and the symbolic dimension of insider threats. The symbolic order represents the cultural and linguistic matrix within which security behaviors acquire meaning.

## Application to Insider Threat Assessment

Symbolic order analysis reveals security vulnerabilities through:
1. Incomplete integration into organizational symbolic structure
2. Foreclosure of security's symbolic dimension
3. Problematic relationships to authority and law
4. Discourse positions creating dysfunctional security behaviors
5. Symbolic violence experiences triggering reactive threats
6. Jouissance in symbolic transgression motivating violations
