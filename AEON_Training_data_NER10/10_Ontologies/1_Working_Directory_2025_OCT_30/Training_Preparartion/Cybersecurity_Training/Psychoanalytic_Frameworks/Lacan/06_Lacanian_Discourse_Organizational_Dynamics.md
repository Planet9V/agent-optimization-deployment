# Lacanian Discourse Theory and Organizational Dynamics

## Overview
This file explores Lacan's four discourses (Master, University, Hysteric, Analyst) and the fifth discourse (Capitalist) in cybersecurity organizational contexts. Each discourse represents a structural position defining relationships between knowledge, power, truth, and production. Understanding discourse positions reveals organizational dynamics and insider threat patterns.

## Four Discourses Framework

### Discourse Structure Elements
- **Agent**: Position from which one speaks
- **Other**: Position addressed, worked upon
- **Production**: What is produced by discourse
- **Truth**: Hidden truth underlying the discourse

## Master's Discourse Concepts
