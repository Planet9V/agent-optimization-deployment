# GE Grid Solutions - Energy Automation Systems

## Product Portfolio Overview

GE Grid Solutions delivers comprehensive control, protection, and automation systems for electrical power networks. The MarkVIe Distributed Control System serves as GE's flagship turbine control platform, deployed across gas turbines, steam turbines, and hydro generators worldwide. MarkVIe architecture supports triple-modular redundancy (TMR) for critical control applications, with controller modules including VCMI (Control Module Interface), VVIB (Versatile I/O Board), and VTCC (Turbine Control Card). The system operates on VxWorks real-time operating system and supports deterministic control loops at 2ms cycle times.

GE MiCOM relay protection portfolio includes numerical protection relays across multiple series. MiCOM P14x line distance protection relays provide five-zone distance protection with directional comparison schemes, supporting transmission line protection up to 500kV. MiCOM P24x feeder management relays integrate overcurrent protection, auto-reclosing, fault location, and power quality monitoring for distribution feeders. MiCOM P40 Agile relays represent GE's IEC 61850-native protection platform, featuring modular hardware architecture with configurable I/O modules and integrated IEC 61850 Edition 2 GOOSE and Sampled Values support.

GE Grid Automation SCADA systems include e500 RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) and e-terraplatform SCADA software. The e500 RTU provides protocol conversion between field devices and control centers, supporting DNP3, IEC 60870-5-101/104, IEC 61850, and Modbus protocols simultaneously. E-terraplatform delivers distributed SCADA architecture with real-time data acquisition supporting up to 500,000 tags per server node, historian database with millisecond resolution, and built-in cybersecurity features including role-based access control and encrypted communications.

## Control System Architecture

MarkVIe control system architecture implements distributed processing across multiple controller types. Triple-Modular Redundant (TMR) controllers provide fault-tolerant control for critical turbine protection functions, comparing three parallel processing streams and voting on outputs to ensure system availability exceeding 99.999%. Simplex controllers handle non-critical monitoring and auxiliary equipment control. The VCMI module serves as the primary processor, running protection algorithms, sequence-of-events recording, and communication protocols. VVIB modules provide analog input conditioning with 16-bit ADC resolution and isolated digital I/O channels supporting 24-250VDC field devices.

MarkVIe ethernet network topology uses dual-redundant 100Mbps fiber optic rings connecting all control modules, HMI workstations, and engineering stations. The system supports EGD (Ethernet Global Data) protocol for deterministic peer-to-peer controller communication with sub-10ms latency. Integration with plant DCS systems occurs via OPC DA/UA servers or Modbus TCP gateways. Remote monitoring capabilities include GE Digital Plant Network for secure cloud connectivity and remote diagnostics.

## Protection and Automation Applications

MiCOM P14x distance protection relays implement quadrilateral impedance characteristics with load encroachment logic, providing selective fault clearance for single-circuit and double-circuit transmission lines. The relays support permissive overreach transfer trip (POTT), directional comparison blocking (DCB), and direct underreach transfer trip (DUTT) communication-aided schemes via dedicated fiber optic channels or multiplexed teleprotection equipment. Integrated fault locator algorithms calculate fault impedance using pre-fault and during-fault voltage and current phasors, achieving location accuracy within 1% of line length.

MiCOM P24x feeder protection relays provide four-stage overcurrent protection (50/51), sensitive earth fault protection (SEF/REF), directional overcurrent elements (67), and voltage-based protection including under/overvoltage (27/59) and voltage unbalance detection. Auto-reclosing logic supports single-shot and multi-shot sequences with synchronism check and dead time coordination. Power quality monitoring functions record voltage sags, swells, harmonics up to 63rd order, and flicker measurements per IEC 61000-4-30 Class A requirements.

## Communication Protocols and Integration

GE protection and control systems support multiple industrial communication protocols for integration across utility and industrial networks. IEC 61850 implementation includes MMS (Manufacturing Message Specification) for client-server communications, GOOSE (Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event) messaging with 4ms transmission times, and Sampled Values (SV) for process bus integration per IEC 61850-9-2LE. DNP3 protocol support encompasses DNP3 Serial (Level 2/3), DNP3 over TCP/IP, and Secure Authentication v5 for cybersecurity hardening.

Legacy protocol support includes IEC 60870-5-101 serial communications and IEC 60870-5-104 TCP/IP variants, enabling integration with European SCADA infrastructure. Modbus RTU and Modbus TCP protocols provide connectivity to third-party PLCs, RTUs, and field instruments. SNTP (Simple Network Time Protocol) and IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) support time synchronization accuracy to sub-millisecond levels for sequence-of-events recording and synchrophasor applications.

GE Grid Solutions integrates with third-party energy management systems (EMS) and distribution management systems (DMS) through standardized ICCP/TASE.2 protocol implementations. The systems support CIM (Common Information Model) data exchange for asset management integration and GIS mapping systems. Cybersecurity features include IEEE 1686 substation security compliance, IEC 62351 security extensions for IEC 61850, and support for defense-in-depth network architectures with DMZ zones and firewall integration.
