## Automatic Generation Control Operations

### AGC System Configuration
**Control Area Management**: Siemens Spectrum-PowerAGC manages Balancing_Authority_Area_Central (control area 45,890 square miles, peak load 5,670 MW) calculating Area Control Error every 4 seconds using frequency deviation measured by Arbiter-1093C GPS clock (±1 microsecond accuracy) and net interchange deviation from scheduled 234 MW export to Neighboring_Control_Area_East. The AGC_Algorithm computes generation adjustments distributing 156 MW regulation requirement across Regulation_Resource_Pool (12 generators totaling 3,890 MW capacity) based on participation factors stored in OSI PI-AF asset framework. Control_Room_Operator monitors AGC performance metrics including CPS1 score 187.3% (NERC standard >100%) and CPS2 compliance 98.7% (standard >90%) displayed on Wonderware System-Platform HMI.

**Economic Dispatch Integration**: The Siemens Spectrum-PowerOPF optimal power flow engine recalculates economic dispatch every 5 minutes using incremental heat rates for Generation_Fleet_Thermal (18 units, 6,780 MW capacity) ranging from Generator_Unit_CC-445 (Mitsubishi M501J combined cycle, 8,450 BTU/kWh) to Generator_Unit_ST-889 (legacy steam unit, 12,890 BTU/kWh). Dispatch_Coordinator validates base points considering transmission constraints calculated through PSS/E contingency analysis showing Transmission_Interface_TI-North limited to 1,890 MW (thermal rating 2,100 MW reduced for N-1 contingency). The economic dispatch algorithm adjusts Generator_Unit_GT-667 output from 389 MW to 421 MW (32 MW increase) while reducing Generator_Unit_ST-778 from 267 MW to 235 MW (32 MW decrease) achieving $2,340/hour production cost savings.

### Regulation Control Implementation
**Primary Frequency Response**: Generator_Unit_GT-445 (GE 7FA.05 turbine, 225 MW) provides primary frequency response through Woodward-505E digital governor (droop setting 5%, deadband ±0.036 Hz) responding to frequency deviation 59.92 Hz measured by governor frequency transducer. The turbine increases output 4.5 MW (2% of rated capacity) within 10 seconds for 0.08 Hz frequency drop following sudden loss of Generator_Unit_CC-778 (340 MW trip). Governor control modulates fuel valve position from 67% to 71% open increasing combustor pressure from 189 psig to 203 psig monitored through GE Mark-VIe control system displaying turbine response on operator HMI.

**Secondary Frequency Control**: AGC system sends regulation signal every 6 seconds to Generator_Unit_CC-556 (Siemens SGT6-8000H combined cycle, 412 MW) through Modbus TCP protocol commanding MW setpoint adjustment from 378 MW to 385 MW (7 MW increase). The plant Emerson Ovation-3.6 distributed control system translates AGC signal to gas turbine load reference driving Siemens control valves adjusting fuel flow 23,450 lb/hr to 24,120 lb/hr (670 lb/hr increase) achieving new output level within 45-second regulation requirement. Unit_Operator monitors regulation performance through OSI PI ProcessBook trending showing Generator_Unit_CC-556 actual output tracking AGC setpoint within ±2 MW (±0.5% accuracy) meeting regulation accuracy standards.

## Generator Synchronization Procedures

### Manual Synchronization Process
**Pre-Sync Verification**: Generator_Operator prepares Generator_Unit_GT-889 (Siemens SGT-800, 57 MW) for synchronization confirming generator voltage 13,620V (98.7% of Bus_Voltage_Station 13,800V) measured by GE 489 generator protection relay and generator frequency 60.15 Hz displayed on Beckwith-M-3425 synchronizer panel. The operator validates excitation system responding correctly through ABB Unitrol-6000 automatic voltage regulator maintaining constant voltage during no-load conditions and turbine governor maintaining steady speed 3,600 rpm (synchronous speed) through Woodward-505E control measuring shaft speed via magnetic pickup on turbine coupling.

**Synchronization Execution**: Using Beckwith-M-3425 synchroscope display showing generator phase angle advancing slowly (slip frequency 0.15 Hz, 9 seconds per revolution), Generator_Operator closes Generator_Breaker_52-GT-889 (ABB VD4-17, 17.5 kV, 31.5 kA interrupting) at 12-o'clock position (zero phase angle) when voltage magnitude difference <1% (13,760V generator vs 13,800V bus) and frequency difference <0.1 Hz (60.05 Hz generator vs 60.00 Hz bus). The synchronizer check relay permits breaker closure confirming synchronization parameters within acceptable limits preventing out-of-phase closing that would produce damaging mechanical torque on Generator_Shaft (stress calculation 15,670 psi if closed at 90° out of phase).

### Automatic Synchronization Systems
**Auto-Sync Configuration**: Generator_Unit_CC-667 (GE 7F.05 gas turbine, 189 MW combined cycle) employs SEL-700G generator protection relay with integrated auto-synchronizer controlling synchronization sequence. The relay adjusts generator voltage through AVR trim signals to ABB Unitrol-5000 exciter and adjusts frequency through governor raise/lower pulses to GE Mark-VIe turbine control achieving match conditions: voltage magnitude within ±2% (13,524-14,076V range around Bus_Voltage 13,800V), frequency within ±0.05 Hz (59.95-60.05 Hz), and phase angle within ±5° measured by voltage transformer inputs from generator terminals and station bus.

**Synchronization Validation**: Upon achieving match conditions, SEL-700G closes Generator_Breaker_52-CC-667 (GE AM-15 metal-clad, 15 kV, 40 kA interrupting) automatically while monitoring synchronizing power transient through CT inputs measuring inrush current 890 A (2.1× normal full-load current 423 A at 13.8 kV). The Control_System_Operator validates successful synchronization through Plant_DCS monitoring reactive power settling to -15 MVAR (leading, indicating slightly high generator voltage requiring AVR adjustment) and active power settling to minimum loading 25 MW (13% of rated capacity) within 10 seconds of breaker closure. Automated sequence continues ramping Generator_Unit_CC-667 to target dispatch 156 MW over 8-minute period using GE turbine controller base load control mode.

## Load Distribution Control

### Parallel Operation Management
**Load Sharing Configuration**: Three generators operate in parallel at Station_Power_Plant (Generator_Unit_GT-445 225 MW, Generator_Unit_GT-556 189 MW, Generator_Unit_GT-667 156 MW totaling 570 MW station output) with governor droop settings coordinated for proportional load sharing. The Woodward-505E governors configured identical 5% droop characteristic ensure Generator_Unit_GT-445 carries 39.5% of load changes, Generator_Unit_GT-556 carries 33.2%, and Generator_Unit_GT-667 carries 27.3% proportional to rated capacities. Plant_Operator monitors load sharing accuracy through Schweitzer SEL-735 power quality meter showing actual distribution Generator_Unit_GT-445 221 MW (38.8%), Generator_Unit_GT-556 192 MW (33.7%), Generator_Unit_GT-667 157 MW (27.5%) within ±2% of theoretical proportions.

**Cross-Limit Control**: When Generator_Unit_GT-445 approaches maximum capability 225 MW limited by turbine exhaust temperature 1,050°F (measured by Rosemount-3144P RTD in exhaust duct), the Plant_DCS Emerson Ovation implements cross-limit control transferring additional load demand to Generator_Unit_GT-556. The control algorithm sends raise signal to Generator_Unit_GT-556 Woodward governor increasing output 192 MW to 205 MW (13 MW increase) while holding Generator_Unit_GT-445 at 223 MW (2 MW below limit) and increasing Generator_Unit_GT-667 from 157 MW to 167 MW (10 MW increase) achieving total station increase 23 MW requested by system AGC. Station_Engineer validates control response maintaining Generator_Unit_GT-445 exhaust temperature 1,045°F (5°F margin) preventing unit trip on high temperature protection.

## Reactive Power Control

### Voltage Regulation Operations
**AVR Control Mode**: Generator_Unit_GT-778 (Siemens SGT-800, 47 MW) operates in automatic voltage control mode with ABB Unitrol-6800 AVR regulating Generator_Terminal_Voltage 13,800V setpoint (1.0 per unit) measured by potential transformers on generator terminals (13,800:120V ratio). The exciter supplies Field_Current 450 A at Field_Voltage 295 VDC to generator rotor through slip rings maintaining terminal voltage constant as reactive load varies from Generator_Reactive_Output -12 MVAR (leading, overexcited) to +8 MVAR (lagging, underexcited) measured by GE Multilin-489 generator protection relay. System_Operator coordinates voltage schedule changes through SCADA commanding AVR setpoint adjustment 13,800V to 14,145V (1.025 per unit) increasing system voltage support during peak load conditions.

**Power Factor Control**: For generators operating in power factor control mode, Generator_Unit_CC-445 maintains 0.95 power factor leading (supplying reactive power to system) through ABB Unitrol-6000 AVR configured power factor regulator mode. The AVR measures Generator_Power_Factor using voltage and current inputs from generator CTs/PTs calculating 0.948 power factor at Generator_Output 389 MW active, -128 MVAR reactive (leading). Control system automatically adjusts Field_Current from 567 A to 589 A (22 A increase) increasing excitation to achieve commanded 0.95 power factor target while maintaining constant active power 389 MW through independent governor control managing fuel flow via GE Mark-VIe turbine control.

### VAR Dispatch Coordination
**System Voltage Support**: Transmission_Operator coordinates reactive power dispatch across Generation_Fleet managing system voltage at Critical_Bus_Substation_Metro maintaining 345 kV ±2% (338-352 kV range) measured by Schweitzer SEL-735 revenue metering. The voltage control strategy commands Generator_Unit_GT-445 increase reactive output from -45 MVAR to -78 MVAR (33 MVAR increase, leading/supplying) and Generator_Unit_GT-667 increase from -34 MVAR to -56 MVAR (22 MVAR increase) providing total 55 MVAR additional support. Voltage_Coordinator validates response through SCADA monitoring Critical_Bus_Substation_Metro voltage increase from 342 kV (99.1% of nominal) to 347 kV (100.6%) within 2-minute response time meeting NERC voltage performance criteria.

**Reactive Capability Limits**: Generator_Operator monitors Generator_Unit_GT-445 operation relative to capability curve displayed on GE Mark-VIe HMI showing current operating point 378 MW active, -89 MVAR reactive within generator capability limited by Field_Current_Maximum 789 A (rotor thermal limit) and Stator_Current_Maximum 9,450 A (stator thermal limit measured by ABB-CHB current transformers). The capability curve indicates at current active power 378 MW, maximum leading reactive capability -123 MVAR and maximum lagging reactive capability +67 MVAR. Plant_Engineer validates operation maintaining adequate margin from capability limits preventing generator protection trip on loss-of-excitation protection (ABB Unitrol-6000 integrated LOE relay, impedance characteristic R=-0.5 per unit, X=1.0 per unit).
