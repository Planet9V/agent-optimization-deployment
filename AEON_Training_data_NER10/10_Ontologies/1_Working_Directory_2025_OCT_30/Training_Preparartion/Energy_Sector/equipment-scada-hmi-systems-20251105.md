## Technical Specifications

SCADA server architecture implements primary/standby redundancy with Oracle Real Application Clusters database achieving automatic failover in 30 seconds. Wide-area network communication uses MPLS circuits with 10 Mbps bandwidth and 99.95% availability service level agreements. RTU concentrators aggregate DNP3 Secure Authentication reducing communication traffic by 60% through intelligent data filtering. Historian compression algorithms achieve 10:1 data reduction while maintaining retrieval accuracy through swinging door trending methodology.

Communication protocols include DNP3 Level 3 with outstation event buffering supporting 50,000 event queue depth preventing data loss during communication failures. IEC 60870-5-104 implementation provides cyclic data transmission at configurable intervals from 1-255 seconds with sequence numbering detecting packet loss. IEC 61850 MMS service model maps logical nodes to SCADA data points through SCSM Specific Communication Service Mapping. Modbus TCP communication uses function code 03 for holding register reads and function code 16 for multiple register writes.

## Operational Characteristics

Alarm management systems implement ISA 18.2 standards with priority-based filtering, shelving capabilities, and alarm flood detection identifying more than 10 alarms per minute. Sequence-of-events recording captures digital state changes with one-millisecond timestamps using IRIG-B synchronized clocks. Trending displays show real-time analog measurements updated at configurable scan rates from 100 milliseconds to 60 seconds. One-line diagram graphics use vector-based SVG format enabling zoom capabilities while maintaining visual clarity.

Cybersecurity controls implement defense-in-depth architecture with demilitarized zones separating corporate IT networks from operational technology SCADA systems. Tofino Xenon Security Appliance provides stateful firewall protection with industrial protocol validation blocking malformed packets.
