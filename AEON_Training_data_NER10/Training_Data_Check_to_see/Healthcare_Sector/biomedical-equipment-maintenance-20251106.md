Warm-up sequence executes 30 exposures incrementally increasing technique factors: initial exposure 80kV 10mA 0.5s (0.4 kW, 0.2 kJ heat load), gradually increasing to final exposure 140kV 50mA 1.0s (7.0 kW, 7.0 kJ). Tube temperature monitoring uses embedded thermistor sensors measuring anode temperature rise from 28°C ambient to 156°C operating temperature, cathode filament temperature stabilizing at 2,400°C (±50°C tolerance maintaining electron emission consistency). Total warm-up procedure duration 8.5 minutes consuming 245 kJ thermal energy (tube heat capacity 7.5 MHU = 10,800 kJ indicating 2.3% capacity used, safe margin before scan operations).

**Tube Cooling Verification**: After high-heat scanning protocol (cardiac CT angiography, 70kVp 400mA 0.28s rotation, 80 rotations total heat load 2.9 MHU = 4,180 kJ), Equipment_Specialist monitors tube cooling performance. Cooling system specification requires tube cooling from 90% capacity (6.75 MHU) to 40% capacity (3.0 MHU) within 30 minutes, actual measured cooling time 26 minutes meeting specification. Cooling performance depends on: tube oil circulation pump (Gorman-Rupp centrifugal pump, 15 GPM flow rate), heat exchanger effectiveness (oil-to-water, 85 kW capacity, 18°C water inlet temperature supplied by facility chiller), and ambient temperature 22°C (specification <25°C for rated cooling performance).
