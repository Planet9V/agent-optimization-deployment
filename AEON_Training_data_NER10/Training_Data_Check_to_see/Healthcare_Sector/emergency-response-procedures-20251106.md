## Code Blue - Cardiac Arrest Response

### Immediate Response Protocol
**Code Blue Activation**: Nurse_Station receives emergency call from Room_445-ICU reporting patient cardiac arrest, activating Code_Blue_Alert via Hospital_Communication_System (Rauland-Responder-5000 nurse call system) broadcasting to: ICU_Emergency_Team (ICU attending physician, critical care nurse, respiratory therapist), Hospital_Code_Team (anesthesiologist, cardiology fellow, pharmacist, chaplain), and Support_Services (security escort, environmental services stat cleaning). Alert transmission time <10 seconds from button press to team pager notification (Spok-Pager-System alphanumeric messages displaying "CODE BLUE ICU Room 445" with timestamp 14:23:47). Emergency_Cart_Supply logs show Crash_Cart_IC-08 (Waterloo-EMS-800-Series cart, 8 drawers organized per AHA guidelines, daily seal verification #2024-11-06-IC08 intact confirming sterile supplies ready).

**Defibrillator Application**: Critical_Care_Nurse applies Defibrillator_Unit_DF-445 (Philips-HeartStart-MRx, biphasic waveform 200J maximum, AED mode and manual mode) attaching adhesive electrode pads (Philips-SMART-Pads-II, 2-year expiration verified current) to patient chest positions: sternum-right-upper (anterior-lateral placement) and cardiac-apex-left-lower per AHA electrode positioning guidelines. Initial rhythm analysis shows Ventricular_Fibrillation 3.2mm amplitude requiring immediate defibrillation, physician orders "Charge to 200 joules biphasic" with verbal "All clear" safety confirmation before shock delivery. Defibrillator display confirms successful charge 200J in 4.2 seconds, shock delivery time 14:24:03 (16 seconds from Code activation to first shock within AHA 2-minute guideline). Post-shock rhythm analysis shows organized rhythm 84 BPM, SpO2 89% improving, blood pressure 78/45 mmHg, continuing CPR high-quality chest compressions 100-120 compressions/minute with metronome guidance.

### Medication Administration Protocol
**Emergency Drug Preparation**: Code_Team_Pharmacist accesses Omnicell_Med_Station automated dispensing cabinet using biometric fingerprint authentication, override code for emergent access retrieves: Epinephrine 1mg/10mL prefilled syringe (Hospira manufacture, lot# EP445889, expiration 2025-08-15 verified), Amiodarone 150mg/3mL vial (Pfizer manufacture, lot# AM223445, expiration 2025-12-20), Sodium Bicarbonate 50mEq/50mL syringe (Hospira, lot# SB889445). Medication preparation follows ISMP double-check protocol: Pharmacist prepares Amiodarone infusion 150mg in 100mL D5W bag (concentration 1.5mg/mL) labeling with patient name, drug name/concentration, preparation time 14:26:15, pharmacist initials; Critical_Care_Nurse performs independent verification checking: right patient (wristband scan), right drug (barcode scan matching order), right dose (150mg confirmed), right route (IV infusion confirmed), right time (stat order confirmed).

**Infusion Administration**: Nurse establishes IV access using 18-gauge peripheral catheter (BD-Insyte-Autoguard, left antecubital location) securing with Tegaderm transparent dressing, connecting SmartPump_Infusion_System (BD-Alaris-8015-PCU with drug library). Amiodarone infusion programmed: loading dose 150mg over 10 minutes (900 mL/hr rate calculation: 100mL ÷ 10min × 60min = 600 mL/hr, system calculating automatically via drug library), maintenance infusion 1mg/minute (concentration 1.5mg/mL requiring 40 mL/hr for 1mg/min dosing). Drug library hard limits prevent programming errors: loading dose minimum duration 10 minutes (preventing excessive infusion rate), maintenance dose maximum 2.2mg/min (preventing overdose), dose error reduction system (DERS) requiring clinical confirmation when programmed dose outside soft limits (0.5-1.5 mg/min typical range). Infusion start time 14:27:45, infusion pump connected to Patient_Monitor displaying drug name, rate, volume infused updated real-time.

## Code Red - Fire Emergency Response

### Fire Alarm Response Procedures
**Alarm Activation Protocol**: Fire_Alarm_Panel (Simplex-4100ES fire alarm control system, addressable device system covering 450,000 sq-ft hospital) receives smoke detector activation from Location_3rd-Floor-East-Wing-Room-334 triggering building-wide response sequence: audible alarm (Wheelock-AS-24MCW horn/strobe devices 85 dB minimum, 15-185 candela strobe meeting ADA requirements), Fire_Department_Dispatch automatic transmission via Honeywell-HPFF Fire Panel Interface to City_Fire_Station_17 (response time <4 minutes emergency vehicle travel distance 1.8 miles), and HVAC_System automatic smoke control activating Smoke_Evacuation_Mode per NFPA-90A standard (shutdown air handling units serving fire zone, pressurize stairwells to 0.10 inch water column positive pressure preventing smoke migration, activate smoke exhaust fans removing 6 air changes per hour from fire floor).

**RACE Protocol Execution**: Staff_Nurse_3E-334 discovering fire in Room_334 (electrical fire from Patient_Entertainment_System overheated power supply) immediately executes RACE procedure: Remove patients from immediate danger (assisted ambulatory patient to hallway, closing room door isolating fire), Activate fire alarm (manual pull station at corridor position 3E-North-Station-8 activating building alarm 14:45:23), Contain fire (closing all corridor fire doors—TrussDor-120-Minute-Rated-Assemblies with electromagnetic holdopen devices releasing upon alarm, compartmentalizing wing into 15,000 sq-ft smoke zones), Extinguish/Evacuate decision based on fire size assessment. Fire_Extinguisher_3E-08 (Amerex-B500-ABC-Type 5-lb capacity, service tag current inspection 2024-09-15, wall-mounted 4 feet above floor per NFPA-10 requirements) deployed by Facility_Engineer discharging monoammonium phosphate agent 8-second duration at 6-foot distance achieving Class-C electrical fire suppression.

### Patient Evacuation Operations
**Horizontal Evacuation**: Charge_Nurse_3E initiates horizontal evacuation moving 12 patients from fire zone (3rd-Floor-East-Wing 22,500 sq-ft area) to adjacent smoke compartment (3rd-Floor-West-Wing safe refuge area) through 4-foot-wide corridor fire door equipped with electromagnetic hold-open device (Potter-HDA-2 rated 200-lb door closing force). Patient transport prioritizes: ambulatory patients self-evacuate with staff escort (4 patients evacuated first 2 minutes), wheelchair patients assisted evacuation (3 patients using hospital wheelchairs 18-inch seat width navigating 6-foot corridor clearance, evacuation time 4 minutes), bed-bound patients using bed evacuation (5 patients transported in Hill-Rom-P3200-Beds electric beds width 39 inches requiring two-person push team, beds unplugged from Nurse_Call_System and transferred through corridor fire doors, evacuation time 8 minutes total). Assembly point established in 3W-Dayroom verified all 12 patients accounted using patient identification wristband scanning and electronic medical record verification.

**Vertical Evacuation Protocol**: Fire_Progression requiring vertical evacuation activates Stairwell_A_North and Stairwell_B_South (2-hour fire-rated exit stairs, 56-inch width, emergency lighting Battery_Backup_System providing 90-minute illumination, photoluminescent exit path marking 50-foot visibility) for ambulatory patient descent. Non-ambulatory patient evacuation uses Evac-Chair-700H evacuation chair (rated 400-lb capacity, track-based stair descent 2 steps per second controlled descent, requires single operator trained in operation) transporting ICU_Patient_445 (weight 185 lb, oxygen-dependent via portable oxygen concentrator Inogen-G5 providing supplemental O2 4 LPM during transport). Stairwell pressurization maintains positive pressure 0.08-0.10 inch water column (Greenheck-BCSF-520 supply fan 15,000 CFM capacity, dedicated intake preventing smoke infiltration) ensuring clear egress path. Evacuation assembly point Hospital_Front_Plaza_North verified by Incident_Commander tracking patient accountability using Rauland-Responder-Evacuation-Module updating real-time patient location and evacuation status displayed on Emergency_Command_Center monitors.
