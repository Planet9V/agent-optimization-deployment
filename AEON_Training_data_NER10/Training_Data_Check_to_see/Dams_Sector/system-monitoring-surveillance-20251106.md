# System Monitoring and Surveillance Operations

## Continuous Dam Safety Monitoring

### Automated Data Collection Systems
**Real-Time Instrumentation Monitoring**: The OPERATION automated surveillance system at Hoover Dam continuously monitors 587 instruments using VENDOR Campbell_Scientific EQUIPMENT CR3000 dataloggers (45 dataloggers, networked via VENDOR Cisco EQUIPMENT Industrial Ethernet, fiber optic backbone, redundant ring topology) collecting OPERATION measurements every 15 minutes from EQUIPMENT piezometers (VENDOR Geokon EQUIPMENT vibrating wire, 245 sensors monitoring OPERATION foundation pressures 150-3,500 kPa range), EQUIPMENT strain gauges (VENDOR Geokon EQUIPMENT Model-4200 sister bar strain meters, 128 sensors measuring OPERATION concrete stress -500 to +2,500 microstrain), and EQUIPMENT seepage weirs (VENDOR Thel-Mar EQUIPMENT V-notch weirs, 89 locations measuring OPERATION drain flows 0.1-50 gpm range with VENDOR Druck EQUIPMENT PTX-1400 pressure transducers). The Data_Management_Engineer configures OPERATION quality control algorithms using VENDOR Aquatic_Informatics EQUIPMENT AQUARIUS software: OPERATION range checking (flagging readings outside OPERATION historical minimum-maximum bounds), OPERATION rate-of-change detection (alerting OPERATION changes exceeding 3-standard-deviations from 90-day moving average), and OPERATION stuck sensor identification (constant readings >6 hours triggering OPERATION maintenance notification) achieving OPERATION data quality >99.2% per PROTOCOL FERC Part 12.37 dam safety monitoring requirements.

**SCADA Integration and Alarming**: The OPERATION supervisory control and data acquisition system (VENDOR Schneider_Electric EQUIPMENT Citect SCADA, 12 operator workstations, 200,000-point tag database, redundant hot-standby servers) integrates OPERATION dam safety instrumentation with OPERATION powerhouse control providing OPERATION unified monitoring interface displaying OPERATION 150 mimic screens (dam cross-sections, foundation plans, seepage schematics). The SCADA_Administrator configures OPERATION hierarchical alarm system: OPERATION information alarms (instrumentation communication failures, sensor battery low, non-critical deviations) displayed as blue notifications, OPERATION warning alarms (threshold exceedances requiring OPERATION engineering review within 24 hours) displayed as yellow alerts with audible tone, OPERATION high alarms (significant anomalies requiring OPERATION immediate response) displayed as red flashing with continuous horn, and OPERATION emergency alarms (critical safety threats triggering PROTOCOL emergency action plan) displayed as magenta with voice annunciation and OPERATION automatic SMS notification to Dam_Safety_Officer and OPERATION Bureau_of_Reclamation regional office. The OPERATION alarm management implements OPERATION suppression logic preventing OPERATION alarm flooding: OPERATION grouping related alarms (12 piezometers in Monolith-25 foundation zone generating single group alarm rather than 12 individual alarms), OPERATION shelving nuisance alarms during OPERATION known maintenance activities, and OPERATION priority-based presentation ensuring OPERATION critical alarms visible above lower-priority alerts per PROTOCOL ISA-18.2 alarm management guidelines achieving OPERATION alarm rate <6 alarms per hour average (PROTOCOL acceptable performance preventing OPERATION operator overload).

### Manual Inspection and Surveillance
