## Checklist Usage Guidelines

### Pre-Implementation
- Review checklists against system architecture
- Identify gaps and dependencies
- Prioritize critical security controls
- Develop implementation roadmap

### During Implementation
- Check off completed items
- Document implementation details
- Test control effectiveness
- Update as requirements evolve

### Post-Implementation
- Conduct comprehensive testing
- Perform security assessment
- Validate against IEC 62443 requirements
- Establish ongoing monitoring

---

## Validation Methodology

### Technical Validation
- Configuration verification
- Functional testing
- Integration testing
- Performance assessment

### Process Validation
- Procedure documentation
- Training verification
- Change management review
- Incident response testing

### Compliance Validation
- Audit trail review
- Security metrics analysis
- Gap analysis
- Remediation planning
