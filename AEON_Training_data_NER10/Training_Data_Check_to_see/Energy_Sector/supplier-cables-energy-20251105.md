## Technical Specifications

High voltage cable construction employs extruded cross-linked polyethylene insulation achieving 0.5% tan delta dielectric loss at 90°C conductor temperature. Conductor materials include annealed copper achieving 100% IACS conductivity or EC-grade aluminum with 61% IACS conductivity in stranded configurations. Insulation shields utilize semiconductive polyethylene with carbon black loading providing 100-500 ohm-meter resistivity smoothing electric field distribution. Metallic shields employ longitudinally applied copper tape or helically wound copper wire achieving 30% or greater neutral current capacity.

Medium voltage cable designs include concentric neutral construction with bare copper wires spiraled around insulation shield providing ground fault current path. Jacketing materials employ polyvinyl chloride, linear low-density polyethylene, or chlorinated polyethylene providing mechanical protection and moisture resistance. Armoring options include galvanized steel wire or aluminum interlocked armor for direct burial applications withstanding 1500 pound crush loads. Fire-resistant cables achieve IEEE 1202 flame test passing with vertical tray configuration preventing flame propagation during 20-minute test duration.

## Manufacturing Capabilities

Cable manufacturing lines include triple extrusion systems simultaneously applying conductor shield, insulation, and insulation shield layers in single continuous process. Vulcanization processes cure XLPE insulation using catenary or continuous vulcanization achieving crosslink degree exceeding 85% measured by gel content. Screening equipment includes partial discharge testing at 3 times rated voltage detecting corona activity below 5 picocoulombs ensuring insulation quality. High potential testing applies AC or DC voltage at 4 times rated voltage for 5 minutes verifying dielectric withstand capability.

Quality control procedures measure insulation thickness at 1-meter intervals using capacitance methods achieving ±5% tolerance across cable length. Conductor resistance testing employs four-wire Kelvin method at 20°C reference temperature validating compliance with ASTM B193 standards. Eccentricity measurements verify concentric conductor positioning within ±10% of insulation thickness preventing electric field concentration. Aging tests simulate 40-year service life through accelerated thermal cycling at elevated temperatures validating long-term reliability.

## Installation Support

Cable sizing calculations account for ampacity derating factors including burial depth, soil thermal resistivity, ambient temperature, and cable spacing following Neher-McGrath methodology. Pulling tension analysis prevents insulation damage limiting sidewall pressure to 300 pounds per foot of bend radius during installation. Bending radius requirements specify minimum radius of 12 times cable outside diameter for single-conductor power cables preventing jacket damage. Splice locations selection avoids areas subject to flooding, vehicle traffic, or future excavation with vault dimensions accommodating splice assembly.

Testing services include very low frequency VLF hipot testing applying 0.1 Hz sinusoidal voltage identifying insulation defects without cable damage. Time-domain reflectometry locates cable faults measuring impedance discontinuities with resolution to 1 meter accuracy. Partial discharge mapping identifies insulation degradation using acoustic sensors detecting corona activity along cable route. Thermal imaging surveys detect hot spots indicating overloaded neutral conductors or deteriorated connections with 0.1°C temperature resolution.

Training programs cover cable installation techniques including duct preparation, pulling lubricant application, tension monitoring, and splice assembly procedures. Technical support provides 24/7 emergency response deploying fault location equipment and repair crews achieving service restoration within 8 hours. Warranty coverage includes 20-year performance guarantees for medium voltage cables with prorated replacement for premature failures. Lifecycle management systems track cable installation dates, maintenance records, and fault history supporting predictive replacement planning.
