# Water Treatment Plant Startup Sequence

## Entity-Rich Introduction

Treatment train startup procedure executes sequential logic program STARTUP_SEQUENCE_TRAIN_1 through STARTUP_SEQUENCE_TRAIN_6 in Allen-Bradley ControlLogix L85E controllers (program file MAIN:Startup_Seq, routine StartupTrain1 through StartupTrain6) initiating equipment in dependency-ordered sequence preventing hydraulic transients and chemical slug formation. Operator initiates startup via Wonderware InTouch HMI screen 250-STARTUP-CTRL by entering target flow rate 35-57 MGD (241,667 GPM maximum per-train capacity), selecting treatment train (dropdown menu trains 1-6), confirming pre-start conditions checklist (20 interlock points validated via PLC tags PLC_TRAIN1.INTLK[1] through PLC_TRAIN1.INTLK[20] checking: inlet valve IS-V-101 closed position verified, chemical feed tanks T-301 alum >40% level, T-401 lime >35% level, clearwell CW-01 >30% level 12 million gallon capacity, electrical supply voltage 480VAC ±10% measured by PowerLogic PM8000 meters).

## Integration & Operations

Pre-start verification checklist automated via PLC logic routine PRE_START_CHECK queries 85 field devices via EtherNet/IP explicit messaging (CIP service 0x4C Read Tag Service) reading equipment ready statuses: Motor control centers (Allen-Bradley ArmorStart LT 281E soft starters, 14 units controlling 15-200HP motors) report thermal overload status via EtherNet/IP tag MCC_MOTOR[1].OL_STATUS through MCC_MOTOR[85].OL_STATUS requiring value = 0 (normal, not tripped), valve actuators (Rotork IQ3 intelligent valve actuators with Modbus TCP, 42 units on IP addresses 192.168.100.101-192.168.100.142) confirm position feedback via Modbus register 40001 reading 0-10000 (0=fully closed, 10000=fully open) compared against expected pre-start positions (inlet valves 0±100 closed, bypass valves 10000±100 open, control valves 3000±200 at 30% intermediate position). Instrument health check validates calibration currency by comparing current timestamp against last calibration date stored in PI System AF attributes: Endress+Hauser Promag P500 flowmeters (8 units, calibration interval 365 days, last calibration dates stored in AF attribute CalibrationDate) flagged overdue if DATEDIFF(day, CalibrationDate, GETDATE()) > 365, Hach SC200 analyzers (24 units for pH/turbidity/chlorine/conductivity, calibration interval 30 days for pH/chlorine, 90 days for turbidity, verification check against AF attributes: sc200_instrument[1].pH_LastCal through sc200_instrument[24].Chlorine_LastCal).

Sequential equipment startup Stage 1 (minutes 0-10) energizes support systems establishing process infrastructure: Instrument air compressors C-601A and C-601B (Gardner Denver EnviroAire rotary screw compressors, 460V 75HP motors, capacity 420 SCFM @ 100 psig) started via soft-starter commands reducing inrush current from 600A to 180A over 15-second ramp, verifying header pressure reaches 95 psig ±5 psig within 120 seconds measured by pressure transmitter PT-601 (Ashcroft K1 series 0-200 psig range), Plant water pumps P-602A and P-602B (Grundfos CR90-4 vertical multistage centrifugal pumps, 15HP 480V, capacity 250 GPM @ 120 psig) supplying seal water for process pumps and chemical dilution water, verifying supply pressure 110 psig ±10 psig from PT-602, Chemical feed dilution systems starting polymer makedown unit PMD-01 (Chem-Feed Systems PDU-500 automatic polymer activation unit, 50 gallon batch tank, Neptune Chemfeed pump 0-50 GPH capacity) preparing 0.5% polymer solution from 100% polyacrylamide powder (SNF Flopam AN934 anionic polymer), Ventilation systems V-BLDG-01 through V-BLDG-08 (Greenheck CUBE centrifugal roof exhausters, 5HP motors, 10,000 CFM capacity each) maintaining building negative pressure -0.02 inches water column measured by Setra 264 differential pressure transmitter preventing chlorine gas migration to occupied spaces.

Stage 2 (minutes 10-20) initiates raw water delivery and preliminary treatment: Raw water booster pumps P-101A and P-101B started in lead-lag configuration (P-101A designated lead pump alternating weekly via PLC timer TON instruction T4:0 counting 604,800 seconds = 1 week), ABB ACS880 VFD (690V 500kW, IP54 enclosure) ramping motor speed from 0 to 1,200 RPM over 30-second acceleration time delivering flow 5,000 GPM initial → 35,000 GPM final at target train flow 50 MGD, electromagnetic flowmeter FIT-101 (Endress+Hauser Promag P500 DN1200 48-inch line size) feeding back actual flow to PLC PID loop PLC_TRAIN1.FLOW_CTRL_RAW updating every 100ms, Coagulant feed system dosing alum (aluminum sulfate liquid 48.8% Al2(SO4)3·14H2O, specific gravity 1.335, viscosity 50 cP @ 70°F) via Milton Roy MilRoyal B96 metering pumps (capacity 0-150 GPH, 480V 2HP motor, digital speed control 4-20mA input from PLC analog output module 1756-OF8 channel 3) starting at 25% speed (37.5 GPH) ramping to calculated dose setpoint: DoseGPH = (TargetMG/L × FlowMGD × 8.34 × SpecificGravity) / (Concentration% × 60) = (30 mg/L × 50 MGD × 8.34 × 1.335) / (0.488 × 60) = 568 GPH requiring 4 parallel pumps at 142 GPH each, Rapid mix chamber RM-201 starting paddle mixer (US Filter paddle wheel flocculator, 25HP 480V motor, fixed speed 35 RPM) providing velocity gradient G = 800 sec⁻¹ for 30-second detention time promoting coagulant dispersion, Streaming current monitor SCM-201 (Chemtrac HydroACT model 6000) monitoring zeta potential -5 to +5 mV indicating coagulation effectiveness, feeding back 4-20mA signal (scaled -10 mV to +10 mV) to PLC analog input 1756-IF16 channel 5 for alum dose trim control ±10 mg/L adjustment.

Stage 3 (minutes 20-30) establishes flocculation and sedimentation: Flocculation basin mixers M-201 through M-212 (12 chambers in series, tapered velocity gradient design) starting in sequence 30-second intervals using Siemens Sinamics G120C VFDs (480V 15kW, PROFINET interface IP 192.168.100.151-192.168.100.162) controlling motor speeds 5-25 RPM variable: Chamber 1-4 G=60 sec⁻¹ (initial floc formation), Chamber 5-8 G=40 sec⁻¹ (floc growth), Chamber 9-12 G=25 sec⁻¹ (floc densification), detention time 20 minutes total (1.67 minutes per chamber at 50 MGD flow), Sedimentation basin inlet gates G-401 through G-408 (8 parallel basins, hydraulic cylinder actuators Rotork RH-3000 with 48-inch stroke) opening sequentially to distribute flow evenly: Gate 1 opening minutes 20-22 (0% → 100% position over 120 seconds), Gate 2 minutes 22-24, continuing through Gate 8 completing minutes 34-36, Basin level control maintaining 15.5 feet ±0.5 feet water depth measured by Endress+Hauser FMX167 radar level transmitters (one per basin, 4-20mA output scaled 0-20 feet range) controlling weir gates WG-401 through WG-408 (Waterman Industries sludge collector with peripheral weir overflow), Surface loading rate 800 gpd/sf at 50 MGD train flow calculated: BasinArea = 50 MGD × 1,000,000 / 800 = 62,500 sf (equivalent to 250 ft length × 250 ft width), Clarified water turbidity monitored by turbidimeters TU-401 through TU-408 (Hach 1720E low-range turbidimeters, 0-10 NTU range, ±2% accuracy) requiring settled water <2.0 NTU before proceeding to filtration.

## Security Implementation

Startup sequence security controls prevent unauthorized process initiation via multi-layered authentication: Two-person rule requires supervisor approval (digital signature via badge reader HID iCLASS SE R40 at operator workstation capturing card UID + PIN entry) before operator can execute startup, approval timeout 300 seconds requiring re-authentication if startup not initiated within 5 minutes of approval grant, audit trail logs supervisor ID + operator ID + timestamp + workstation ID to SQL Server table StartupApprovals. Change control integration requires active work order in IBM Maximo CMMS before startup sequence can be initiated: PLC ladder logic routine CHECK_WORK_ORDER queries Maximo database via OPC UA (Matrikon OPC UA Tunnel to Maximo REST API integration) verifying work order WO-STARTUP-TRAINX exists with status APPROVED and scheduled start time within ±30 minutes of current time, rejection message displayed on HMI if work order missing/expired/wrong train assignment. Safety interlock bypass prevention uses cryptographic tokens: Override capability for non-critical interlocks (INT-008 through INT-020) requires one-time-password (OTP) generated by supervisor's YubiKey 5 NFC hardware token (TOTP algorithm, 30-second window, 6-digit code), OTP validated against time-synchronized server (FreeRADIUS with Google Authenticator PAM module), bypass logged with justification text field (minimum 50 characters) to audit database table InterlockBypass including: Interlock ID, Override code, Supervisor ID, Operator ID, Justification, Duration (maximum 3600 seconds), Timestamp start/end, critical safety interlocks INT-001 through INT-007 (protecting personnel safety: chlorine gas detection, electrical fault detection, emergency stop circuits) cannot be bypassed under any circumstances enforced by hardware lockout requiring physical key switch at main electrical panel.
