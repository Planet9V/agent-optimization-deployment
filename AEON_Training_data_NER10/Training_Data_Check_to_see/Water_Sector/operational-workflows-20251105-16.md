## Integration & Operations

Normal operation sequence begins with raw water intake from reservoir (Lake Treatment Reservoir elevation 1,250 ft MSL, storage capacity 12 billion gallons) pumped via 4× vertical turbine intake pumps (Goulds Water Technology model 3410 series, 500HP motors, 12,000 GPM @ 180 ft TDH) controlled by Allen-Bradley PowerFlex 755T VFDs (catalog 20F11NC145JA0NNNNN) receiving 4-20mA speed reference signals from ControlLogix L85E PLC tag PLC_INTAKE.PID_FLOW_CONTROL.OUT maintaining raw water flow setpoint 235 MGD (163,194 GPM) with feedback from Endress+Hauser Promag P500 electromagnetic flowmeter (DN1200/48-inch pipe size, accuracy ±0.2% of rate, Modbus TCP output on 192.168.100.50:502 updating holding registers 40001-40010 every 1 second). Chemical dosing control implements cascade PID loops: Primary loop maintains finished water pH setpoint 7.8 by adjusting alum dose 15-45 mg/L calculated from streaming current monitor (SCM) feedback (Chemtrac HydroACT analyzer measuring zeta potential -5 to +5 mV indicating optimal coagulation zone), secondary loop trims lime dose 8-25 mg/L for alkalinity control using online pH analyzer (Hach SC200 controller with pHD differential pH sensor, 2-wire 4-20mA output scaled 6.0-9.0 pH range). ControlLogix ladder logic program CHEM_DOSE_CONTROL (scan time 50ms) calculates chemical feed pump speeds: alum feed pumps (Milton Roy MilRoyal B series metering pumps, 0-150 GPH capacity) receive speed commands via Modbus TCP function code 0x06 writing setpoint to holding register 40102 on Milton Roy MilNet gateway (IP 192.168.100.75), lime slurry pumps (Netzsch NEMO progressing cavity pumps model BN70-6L, 0-200 GPH) controlled via PROFINET RT to Siemens G120C VFDs maintaining target feed rates calculated from flow-paced dosing algorithm: Dose(mg/L) = Setpoint × (CurrentFlow/DesignFlow) × CompensationFactor.

Shift handoff procedures (performed at 0700 and 1900 hours daily) require outgoing operator to complete digital shift report in Wonderware InTouch via dedicated Shift Report HMI screen (Screen ID 900-SHIFT-REPORT) documenting: Equipment status table (24 critical assets including high-service pumps, filter banks, chemical feeders with run-time counters displayed from PLC tag arrays PLC_EQUIPMENT[1].RUNTIME_HOURS through PLC_EQUIPMENT[24].RUNTIME_HOURS), Process parameter summary (turbidity trending, chlorine residual values, pH readings, flow totals from PI System trend displays embedded in HMI showing last 12-hour period), Alarm summary (count of P1/P2/P3/P4 alarms during shift from Wonderware Alarm DB query: SELECT Priority, COUNT(*) FROM AlarmHistory WHERE Timestamp > DATEADD(hour, -12, GETDATE()) GROUP BY Priority), Maintenance activities (work orders completed from IBM Maximo v7.6.1 maintenance management system integrated via REST API, displaying PM-12345 preventive maintenance on filter #8 backwash valve replaced, WO-54321 corrective maintenance on chlorine analyzer replaced sensor), Operational notes (free-text field for unusual conditions: "Train 3 running at reduced rate 45 MGD due to high headloss on filters 13-16, scheduled backwash sequence initiated"). Incoming operator acknowledges receipt via digital signature (captured via Topaz SigLite 1×5 signature pad USB device, signature image stored in SQL Server database table ShiftReports with timestamp, operator ID, hash for non-repudiation) and reviews outstanding alarm conditions prioritizing response to: P1 Critical alarms (emergency conditions requiring immediate action within 60 seconds: chlorine gas leak detected by Sierra Monitor LD5000 controller triggering evacuation alarm, high-service pump trip on overcurrent requiring manual restart), P2 High alarms (abnormal process conditions requiring action within 5 minutes: filter effluent turbidity >0.5 NTU indicating breakthrough requiring filter-to-waste diversion), P3 Medium alarms (advisory conditions requiring monitoring: chemical tank level <20% triggering delivery request), P4 Low alarms (informational status: equipment runtime milestone 2,000 hours triggering PM scheduling).

Performance monitoring displays KPIs calculated in real-time via PI System Asset Framework (AF) analytics with 1-minute update frequency: Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) = Availability × Performance × Quality calculated as: Availability = (Scheduled Hours - Downtime Hours) / Scheduled Hours (target ≥98.5%, typical 97.8%), Performance = Actual Flow / Design Flow (target ≥92%, typical 94.2%), Quality = Volume Meeting Specs / Total Volume Produced (target ≥99.5%, typical 99.7%), Overall OEE = 0.978 × 0.942 × 0.997 = 91.9% (target ≥95%). Treatment efficiency metrics tracked include: Turbidity removal efficiency = (Raw - Finished) / Raw × 100% (raw water 15-250 NTU seasonal variation, finished water 0.04-0.08 NTU, efficiency 99.5-99.98%), TOC (total organic carbon) removal (raw water 2.5-4.5 mg/L, finished water 1.2-2.0 mg/L, 40-60% removal meeting Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule requirements), Log reduction credits (3-log Giardia via filtration + 3-log via chlorine disinfection = 6-log total, 4-log virus via filtration + 2-log via chlorine = 6-log total). Energy consumption monitoring via Schneider Electric PowerLogic PM8000 power meters (Modbus TCP on 192.168.100.201-192.168.100.224) measures: High-service pump energy 42% of total plant consumption (target 0.85 kWh/kgal, actual 0.79 kWh/kgal from VFD speed optimization), treatment process energy 28% (coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation mixers, filter backwash pumps), chemical preparation 18% (lime slakers, polymer makedown systems), HVAC and lighting 12%.

Regulatory compliance reporting automated via PI System integrations generates: Daily operating reports via PI Vision (https://pivision.waterutility.local:443) dashboard displaying 24-hour trends of turbidity (all filter effluents + combined filter effluent + finished water), chlorine residual (clear well + distribution system entry points), pH (raw water + settled water + finished water + distribution system), flow (raw water intake + finished water + distribution zone flows), Monthly Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs) generated via PI DataLink Excel add-in extracting PI tag data for EPA permit parameters (daily maximum turbidity from tag PI_TURBIDITY_FINISHED_MAX_DAILY, monthly average from tag PI_TURBIDITY_FINISHED_AVG_MONTHLY), Consumer Confidence Reports (CCRs) generated annually compiling regulated contaminant data (microbiological: total coliform <5% positive, E.coli zero detects; turbidity: 99.95% <0.3 NTU; disinfection byproducts: TTHM 42 μg/L <80 MCL, HAA5 28 μg/L <60 MCL; lead/copper: 90th percentile lead 8 μg/L <15 action level), Sanitary surveys conducted every 3 years per EPA requirements evaluating 8 components (source, treatment, distribution, finished water storage, pumps/facilities/equipment, monitoring/reporting, system management/operation, operator compliance).

## Security Implementation

Operational security controls enforce IEC 62443-2-4 security program requirements: Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented in Wonderware System Platform using Windows Active Directory integration defines 6 operational roles mapped to AD security groups: Operator View-Only (WU-SCADA-Operators-RO group, 15 users) allows HMI navigation and trend viewing but blocks all control actions, Operator Control (WU-SCADA-Operators-RW group, 24 users) enables process adjustments within defined limits (pump speed ±10%, chemical dose ±20%, valve position adjustments), Supervisor (WU-SCADA-Supervisors group, 8 users) permits setpoint changes and mode transitions (automatic/manual mode, enable/disable equipment, alarm acknowledgment/suppression), Maintenance (WU-SCADA-Maintenance group, 12 users) grants equipment control during PM activities and calibration procedures, Engineering (WU-SCADA-Engineers group, 6 users) allows HMI graphics editing and historical data export, Administrator (WU-SCADA-Admins group, 3 users) full system administration including user management and security policy configuration. Audit logging captures 42 event types: Authentication events (successful login with username/workstation/timestamp, failed login attempts >3 trigger 15-minute account lockout), Control actions (valve open/close commands with before/after position values, pump start/stop with equipment ID and operator ID, setpoint changes logging old value → new value with delta calculation), Alarm acknowledgments (tracking operator response time from alarm activation to acknowledgment, mean time to acknowledge MTTA target <90 seconds for P2 alarms), Configuration changes (HMI graphics modifications, database schema changes, security policy updates), exported to Splunk SIEM via syslog RFC 5424 over TLS (TCP port 6514) for correlation with network security events and long-term retention (7-year retention per AWWA G430 security practices).
