## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Project Overview

The AEON Digital Twin Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence Ontology Version 2 Enhancement represents a systematic expansion from 183,069 nodes to a target of 307,569+ nodes through 12 carefully orchestrated enhancement waves over 15 weeks. This project will add 124,500+ nodes representing advanced threat intelligence concepts, multi-sector critical infrastructure coverage, psychometric threat actor profiling, and comprehensive IT infrastructure modeling.

**Current State (Baseline):**
- Total Nodes: 183,069
  - CVE Nodes: 147,923 (80.8%)
  - Organization Nodes: 15,218 (8.3%)
  - Sector Nodes: 16 (0.01%)
  - System Nodes: 8,942 (4.9%)
  - Location Nodes: 195 (0.1%)
  - Supporting Nodes: 10,775 (5.9%)
- Total Relationships: ~450,000 (estimated)
- Database Size: ~12 GB
- Query Performance: Average 1.2 seconds for complex queries

**Target State (Wave 12 Complete):**
- Total Nodes: 307,569+ (67.9% increase)
  - CVE Nodes: 147,923 (unchanged - protected)
  - New Threat Intelligence Nodes: 18,500+
  - New IT Infrastructure Nodes: 5,000+
  - New Psychometric Profile Nodes: 1,000+
  - New SAREF/IoT Nodes: 2,500+
  - New Critical Infrastructure Nodes: 95,000+
  - Enhanced Organization/System Nodes: 37,646+
- Total Relationships: 1,200,000+ (167% increase)
- Database Size: ~32 GB (projected)
- Query Performance: Maintained at <2 seconds for 95% of queries
