# Bank Vault Time Lock Operations

## Overview
Bank vault time lock systems provide multi-layered physical security for currency, securities, and safe deposit boxes through dual control access procedures, time-delay mechanisms, and comprehensive audit logging, ensuring protection against external threats and internal collusion while maintaining operational efficiency.

## Operational Procedures

### 1. Time Lock Mechanism Configuration
- **Time Delay Settings**: Mechanical or electronic time locks programmed with delay periods (typically 15 minutes to 24 hours) preventing immediate vault opening
- **Business Hours Programming**: Time locks automatically engage outside business hours; vault cannot open until programmed time regardless of correct combinations entered
- **Holiday Schedule Updates**: Vault managers reprogram time locks for bank holidays and special closures, extending delay periods for long weekends
- **Emergency Override Limitations**: Time locks include physical key overrides requiring senior officer authorization and documentation for emergency access

### 2. Dual Control Access Procedures
- **Dual Custody Requirements**: Vault opening requires two authorized employees, each with unique combinations or access codes, present simultaneously
- **Combination Segregation**: Each authorized person knows only portion of combination; full combination requires collaboration preventing unilateral access
- **Role-Based Access Matrix**: Vault officers, branch managers, and senior management have different access levels and time restrictions programmed into electronic locks
- **Access Revocation Protocols**: Terminated employees have combinations immediately changed; resigned employees' access revoked on final work day

### 3. Vault Opening Procedures - Morning Operations
- **Arrival Time Verification**: Vault officers arrive at least 30 minutes before branch opening to complete vault opening procedures
- **Dual Custody Confirmation**: Both authorized employees verify identities and sign vault access log with timestamps
- **Time Lock Release**: First employee enters combination portion after time lock expires; second employee enters remaining combination digits
- **Interior Inspection**: Visual inspection of vault interior for signs of tampering, unauthorized entry attempts, or environmental damage before proceeding

### 4. Currency and Valuables Handling
- **Cash Inventory Verification**: Morning and evening cash counts reconcile against prior business day closing balances documented on vault logs
- **Bundled Currency Procedures**: Bills banded in standard straps ($100, $1,000, $10,000) and stored in labeled compartments by denomination
- **Coin Handling**: Rolled coins stored separately; loose coin bags weighed and recorded for approximate value verification
- **Safe Deposit Box Access**: Dual control access to safe deposit vault; customer entry logged with date/time, box number, and authorized signatures

### 5. Vault Closing Procedures - End of Day
- **Final Transaction Verification**: All teller drawers balanced and closed before vault closing procedures begin
- **Cash Inventory Count**: Currency and coin totals verified by two vault officers independently; discrepancies investigated before proceeding
- **Vault Log Completion**: Daily vault access log signed by closing officers documenting opening/closing times and inventory balances
- **Time Lock Activation**: Mechanical or electronic time locks engaged; vault door sealed and armed with intrusion detection systems

### 6. Emergency Access Procedures
- **After-Hours Access Justification**: Emergency vault access outside business hours requires written authorization from two senior officers
- **Alarm Response Coordination**: Security company notified in advance of after-hours access to prevent false alarm dispatches
- **Override Key Custody**: Physical override keys stored in sealed envelopes at secure offsite locations (e.g., regional headquarters)
- **Post-Emergency Audit**: All emergency vault access incidents reviewed by internal audit within 48 hours with full documentation required

### 7. Audit Trail and Compliance Monitoring
- **Electronic Audit Logs**: Digital time locks record every access attempt (successful and failed) with user ID, timestamp, and action taken
- **Video Surveillance Integration**: Vault cameras continuously record with synchronized timestamps matching audit log entries
- **Quarterly Combination Changes**: Vault combinations rotated quarterly or whenever authorized personnel changes occur
- **Annual Penetration Testing**: Third-party security consultants attempt to defeat vault security measures; findings addressed immediately

- **Access Control Systems**: Electronic locks integrated with facility access control systems tracking employee badge-ins and vault area access
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Temperature and humidity sensors protect paper currency and documents from degradation; alerts trigger if thresholds exceeded

### Alarm Monitoring Services
- **Central Station Connectivity**: Vault alarm systems transmit signals to UL-certified central monitoring stations for 24/7 response
- **Duress Codes**: Employees can enter special codes signaling coercion during robbery; appears normal but triggers silent police dispatch
- **Audio Verification**: Two-way voice communication allows monitoring center to assess emergency situations before dispatching authorities
- **Video Verification**: Advanced systems transmit video clips of alarm events to monitoring center for visual confirmation before response

### Cash Management Systems
- **Currency Ordering Integration**: Vault cash levels monitored; automated orders placed with Federal Reserve or correspondent banks when inventory falls below thresholds
- **Cash Forecasting**: Predictive analytics estimate branch cash needs based on historical patterns, upcoming events, and seasonal trends
- **Armored Courier Scheduling**: Vault cash pickups/deliveries coordinated with armored car companies (Brinks, Loomis) via secure scheduling platforms
- **Inventory Reconciliation**: Daily vault balances uploaded to core banking system for branch cash position reporting and GL posting

### Compliance and Audit Reporting
