# Integrated Page Concept: The Threat Hunter (Profiling & NER11 Gold)

## 1. Persona Evaluation & Strategy
*   **Evaluator**: "The Hunter" (Psychometric/Ops Expert)
*   **Critique**: "The 'Profiler' is fun but feels like a game. 'NER11 Gold' is too abstract. We need to show *how* the AI reads the mind of the enemy. It's not just about connecting dots; it's about *knowing* them better than they know themselves."
*   **Consolidation Strategy**: Merge `page_concept_threat_actor_personality.md`, `page_concept_ner10_training.md`, and `page_concept_aeon_subminds.md` (specifically the 'Hunter' submind) into a gritty, high-stakes "Adversary Analysis" experience.

## 2. Core Concept: "The Mind of the Enemy"
This page shifts the focus from "Malware" to "Motivation." It visualizes the AI not as a firewall, but as a profiler sitting across the table from the hacker.

## 3. The "Wow" Visualization
**The Neural Interrogation Room**
*   **Visual**: A dark, cinematic "Digital Corkboard" that floats in 3D space.
*   **Interaction**:
    *   **The Evidence**: Raw text (chat logs, dark web posts) flows in on the left (NER11 Gold).
    *   **The Extraction**: Glowing lines connect words like "fear," "greed," "ego" to a central 3D avatar of the Threat Actor.
    *   **The Profile**: The avatar shifts morphology based on the psychometric profile (e.g., "Narcissistic" = larger, unstable halo).

## 4. Key Narrative & Copy
*   **Headline**: "We Don't Just Block IPs. We Profile Personalities."
*   **Sub-headline**: "Psychometric Threat Intelligence & NER11 Gold Extraction."
*   **Body Copy**: "Every line of code is a fingerprint of the mind that wrote it. AEON's NER11 Gold engine reads between the bytes, extracting 53 distinct psychometric markers from threat actor communications. We predict their next move by understanding their fear, their greed, and their cognitive biases."

## 5. Integrated Features
*   **The Live Transcript**: (From NER11 Gold) A scrolling terminal showing the AI tagging text in real-time. `[User: DarkOverlord] "Pay or we burn it." -> [Tag: Machiavellianism (0.9)]`
*   **The Actor Card**: (From Profiler) A detailed dossier card that flips to reveal "Predicted Targets" and "Negotiation Leverage."
*   **The Submind Voice**: (From Subminds) "The Hunter" agent provides audio/text commentary on the profile. "Subject is exhibiting signs of desperation. Recommend stalling tactics."

## 6. Technical Implementation
*   **Stack**: React + D3.js (Force Directed Graph for the corkboard) + WebGL (for the avatar).
*   **Text Density**: High. This page includes full "Psychometric Reports" for sample threat actors (Lazarus, Conti, etc.).
