# Integrated Page Concept: The Executive Command (Strategy & ROI)

## 1. Persona Evaluation & Strategy
*   **Evaluator**: "The Board Member" (ROI/Vision Expert)
*   **Critique**: "The 'Executive Briefing' is good sales copy. The 'Roadmap' is functional. The 'Investor Scroll' is beautiful. But I need one place where I can see the *Money*, the *Risk*, and the *Vision*. Don't make me click three times to decide if I should fund this."
*   **Consolidation Strategy**: Merge `page_concept_executive_briefing.md`, `page_concept_executive_roadmap.md`, `page_concept_investor_long_scroll.md`, and `page_concept_vision_critique.md` into a high-impact "Boardroom of the Future" experience.

## 2. Core Concept: "The Fiduciary Dashboard"
This page speaks the language of money and risk. It translates "Cybersecurity" into "Business Continuity" and "Investment Opportunity."

## 3. The "Wow" Visualization
**The Holographic Globe of Risk**
*   **Visual**: A pristine, rotating glass globe.
*   **Interaction**:
    *   **The Shield**: A glowing "Protection Layer" surrounds the globe, pulsing with stopped attacks.
    *   **The ROI Counter**: A live ticker at the top: "Value Preserved: $4.2B."
    *   **The Timeline**: Scrolling down tilts the globe to show the "Future Horizon" (Roadmap).

## 4. Key Narrative & Copy
*   **Headline**: "Security is Not a Cost. It's an Asset."
*   **Sub-headline**: "The First Platform to Quantify the ROI of Cyber Resilience."
*   **Body Copy**: "For decades, cybersecurity was a black hole for budget. AEON changes the equation. By integrating McKenney-Lacan Calculus with real-time threat intelligence, we provide a definitive 'Fiduciary Score' for your digital estate. We don't just stop hackers; we protect shareholder value."

## 5. Integrated Features
*   **The ROI Calculator**: (From Executive Briefing) An interactive slider: "If we invest $X in AEON, we avoid $Y in probable ransomware costs."
*   **The Readiness Gauge**: (From Roadmap) A "Defcon-style" clock showing the organization's readiness for the next paradigm shift.
*   **The Vision Statement**: (From Investor Scroll) Cinematic parallax sections telling the story of "From Chaos to Order."

## 6. Technical Implementation
*   **Stack**: React + Three.js (Globe) + Framer Motion (Smooth Parallax).
*   **Aesthetics**: "Apple Investor Relations" style. Clean, white/dark modes, serif typography for authority.
