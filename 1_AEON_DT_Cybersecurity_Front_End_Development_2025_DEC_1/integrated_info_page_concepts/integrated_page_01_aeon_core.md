# Integrated Page Concept: The AEON Core (Architecture & Hybrid Engine)

## 1. Persona Evaluation & Strategy
*   **Evaluator**: "The Architect" (Skeptic/Technical Expert)
*   **Critique of Source Pages**: "The '6-Level Architecture' is good but too vertical. The 'Hologram' is flashy but needs substance. The 'Hybrid Engine' is the real differentiator but feels isolated. We need to combine the *structure* of the 6-levels with the *immersion* of the Hologram and the *logic* of the Hybrid engine."
*   **Consolidation Strategy**: Merge `page_concept_6_level_architecture.md`, `page_concept_architecture_hologram.md`, and `page_concept_hybrid_architecture.md` into a single, definitive "System Architecture" experience.

## 2. Core Concept: "The Living Citadel"
This is not a diagram; it is a blueprint that breathes. It visualizes the AEON stack not just as layers, but as a living organism where the "Split-Brain" (Hybrid Engine) powers the "Body" (6-Level Stack).

## 3. The "Wow" Visualization
**The Transparent Skyscraper**
*   **Visual**: A massive, rotating, semi-transparent 3D tower representing the 6 levels.
*   **Interaction**:
    *   **Scroll**: As you scroll down, the camera dives *into* the tower.
    *   **Level 1 (Physical)**: You see the "Hologram City" of assets.
    *   **Level 3 (Hybrid Core)**: The camera pauses at the "Brain." You see the "Synapse" visualization (Vector + Graph) firing in real-time.
    *   **Level 6 (Psychohistory)**: You emerge at the top into a "Cloud of Probability."

## 4. Key Narrative & Copy
*   **Headline**: "Structure. Context. Intelligence."
*   **Sub-headline**: "The World's First Hybrid Graph-Vector Cognitive Architecture."
*   **Body Copy**: "Traditional security tools are flat. AEON is vertical. Built on a revolutionary 'Split-Brain' architecture, we fuse the rigid structure of Knowledge Graphs (Neo4j) with the fluid intuition of Vector Embeddings (Qdrant). This isn't just a stack; it's a nervous system for your critical infrastructure."

## 5. Integrated Features
*   **The Elevator Ride**: (From 6-Level) A navigation rail allowing instant jumps between layers.
*   **The Explorable City**: (From Hologram) A "View Map" toggle that turns the background into the 3D city model.
*   **The Synapse Demo**: (From Hybrid) A live interactive module where you type a query and watch it split into "Vector Search" and "Graph Traversal" paths.

## 6. Technical Implementation
*   **Stack**: React Three Fiber + Drei (for the Glass/Transmission materials).
*   **Performance**: Level-of-Detail (LOD) loading for the city model.
