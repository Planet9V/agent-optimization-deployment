# Integrated Page Concept: The Truth & Governance (Standards & Verification)

## 1. Persona Evaluation & Strategy
*   **Evaluator**: "The Auditor" (Governance/Compliance Expert)
*   **Critique**: "The 'Truth Engine' is brilliant but aggressive. The 'Universal Translator' is necessary but dry. The 'Master Index' is just a list. I need a place where I can verify that the organization is *compliant*, *honest*, and *on track*. Show me the proof."
*   **Consolidation Strategy**: Merge `page_concept_truth_engine.md`, `page_concept_universal_translator.md`, and `page_concept_enhancement_master_index.md` into a "Governance & Standards" hub.

## 2. Core Concept: "The Single Source of Truth"
This page is the antidote to organizational chaos. It uses the "Diff Tool" metaphor to show how AEON aligns Policy (Wiki) with Reality (Database) and Standards (STIX/IEC).

## 3. The "Wow" Visualization
**The Reality Distortion Field**
*   **Visual**: A split-screen 3D view.
*   **Interaction**:
    *   **Left Side (The Claim)**: Shows the "Wiki" version of the network (e.g., "All servers patched").
    *   **Right Side (The Reality)**: Shows the "Live Graph" version (e.g., "3 servers unpatched").
    *   **The Merge**: A "Sync" button fires a laser that burns away the false nodes on the left, aligning them with reality.

## 4. Key Narrative & Copy
*   **Headline**: "The End of Organizational Delusion."
*   **Sub-headline**: "Automated Governance, Wiki Verification, and Protocol Translation."
*   **Body Copy**: "Organizations drift. Documentation rots. AEON's Truth Engine constantly compares your 'As-Designed' documentation (Wiki) with your 'As-Built' reality (Graph). We don't just flag discrepancies; we heal them. Combined with our Universal Translator for STIX and OT protocols, we ensure your security posture is based on facts, not faith."

## 5. Integrated Features
*   **The Diff Engine**: (From Truth Engine) A code-diff style interface for organizational facts.
*   **The Babel Fish**: (From Universal Translator) A live stream showing raw Modbus/STIX data being normalized into the Graph.
*   **The Strategic Roadmap**: (From Master Index) A "Galaxy Map" showing the status of all 27 governance enhancements.

## 6. Technical Implementation
*   **Stack**: React + Monaco Editor (for the Diff View) + D3.js (for the Roadmap).
*   **Text Density**: Medium. Includes the full "Enhancement Master Index" as a searchable table below the fold.
