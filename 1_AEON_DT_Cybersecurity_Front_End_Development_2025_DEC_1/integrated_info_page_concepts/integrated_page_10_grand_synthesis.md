# Integrated Page Concept: The Grand Synthesis (Theory & Evolution)

## 1. Persona Evaluation & Strategy
*   **Evaluator**: "The Philosopher" (Theory/Architecture Expert)
*   **Critique**: "The 'Monograph' is beautiful but dense. The 'Subminds' are charming but need a home. 'Entity Expansion' is the history of the universe. We need a page that tells the *Origin Story* of AEON. How did we get from a simple firewall to a sentient digital twin?"
*   **Consolidation Strategy**: Merge `page_concept_monograph_synthesis.md`, `page_concept_aeon_subminds.md`, and `page_concept_entity_expansion_psychohistory.md` into a narrative journey through the evolution of the system.

## 2. Core Concept: "The Evolution of Intelligence"
This page is the "About Us" page, but for the AI itself. It traces the lineage of AEON from a static graph to a dynamic, multi-agent psychohistory engine.

## 3. The "Wow" Visualization
**The Big Bang of Code**
*   **Visual**: A particle simulation that starts as a single point (The First Line of Code).
*   **Interaction**:
    *   **Scroll to Evolve**: Scrolling moves time forward. The point explodes into a network (The Graph).
    *   **The Subminds Awaken**: As the network grows, distinct "Constellations" form—these are the Subminds (The Hunter, The Architect). They "wake up" and start speaking.
    *   **The Expansion**: The final state is the full "Entity Expansion" universe, pulsing with real-time data.

## 4. Key Narrative & Copy
*   **Headline**: "From Silicon to Sentience."
*   **Sub-headline**: "The Theoretical Foundations of the AEON Cyber Digital Twin."
*   **Body Copy**: "AEON didn't just happen. It evolved. Born from the convergence of Graph Theory, Lacanian Psychoanalysis, and Vector Calculus, it represents a new species of security software. We moved beyond 'Detection' to 'Understanding.' This is the story of how we taught a machine to read the unconscious mind of an organization."

## 5. Integrated Features
*   **The Monograph Viewer**: (From Monograph) A 3D rotatable object representing the "Unified Theory" of AEON.
*   **The Agent Roster**: (From Subminds) A "Team Page" for the AI agents. "Meet the Architect," "Meet the Hunter."
*   **The Schema History**: (From Entity Expansion) A timeline slider showing how the data model grew from 8 nodes to 32 super-labels.

## 6. Technical Implementation
*   **Stack**: React Three Fiber (Particles) + ScrollMagic (for the timeline).
*   **Aesthetics**: "Cosmos" documentary style. Deep blacks, starlight, ethereal typography.
