# Integrated Page Concept: The Psychohistory Center (Prediction & Simulation)

## 1. Persona Evaluation & Strategy
*   **Evaluator**: "The Futurist" (Strategy/Innovation Expert)
*   **Critique**: "The 'Population Forecast' is powerful but static. 'Cyber Epidemics' is scary but needs a solution. 'Simulation Engine' is the tool, but what is it simulating? We need to combine the *Forecast* (What will happen) with the *Simulation* (What we can do about it)."
*   **Consolidation Strategy**: Merge `page_concept_population_forecast.md`, `page_concept_cyber_epidemics.md`, `page_concept_simulation_engine.md`, and `page_concept_now_next_never.md` into a "Command Center for the Future."

## 2. Core Concept: "The Asimov Engine"
This page is the realization of the Psychohistory dream. It doesn't just show data; it shows *timelines*. It allows the user to navigate the "Probabilistic Future" of their organization.

## 3. The "Wow" Visualization
**The Branching Timeline Map**
*   **Visual**: A 3D "River of Time" flowing from left (Present) to right (Future).
*   **Interaction**:
    *   **The Mainstream**: The central river shows the "Most Likely Future" (e.g., "Ransomware Wave in Q3").
    *   **The Divergence**: Users can click "Intervention Points" (e.g., "Patch Now"). The river branches into a new, cleaner timeline.
    *   **The Storm**: Dark clouds over specific regions represent "Population Vulnerability" (from the Forecast model).

## 4. Key Narrative & Copy
*   **Headline**: "Predict the Crisis. Fork the Future."
*   **Sub-headline**: "Population-Scale Psychohistory & Monte Carlo Simulation."
*   **Body Copy**: "In a chaotic world, the only defense is foresight. AEON's Psychohistory Center ingests global demographic data, economic indicators, and threat intelligence to model the 'Probabilistic Future' of your sector. We don't just tell you what's happening NOW; we tell you what's NEXT, and how to ensure the worst case NEVER happens."

## 5. Integrated Features
*   **The Weather Map**: (From Population Forecast) A layer on the timeline showing "Vulnerability Density" heatmaps.
*   **The Epidemic Tracker**: (From Cyber Epidemics) A visual overlay showing the $R_0$ (Infection Rate) of active threats.
*   **The Triage Matrix**: (From Now/Next/Never) A dashboard panel that auto-sorts threats based on the simulation results. "If this isn't patched NOW, the timeline collapses in 3 days."

## 6. Technical Implementation
*   **Stack**: React + Three.js (Particle Systems for the "River").
*   **Math**: Real-time Monte Carlo simulation running in WebAssembly (Wasm) for performance.
