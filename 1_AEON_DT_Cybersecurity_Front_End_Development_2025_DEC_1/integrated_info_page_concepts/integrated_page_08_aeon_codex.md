# Integrated Page Concept: The AEON Codex (Documentation & Intelligence)

## 1. Persona Evaluation & Strategy
*   **Evaluator**: "The Analyst" (Detail-Oriented/Research Expert)
*   **Critique**: "The 'User Stories' page is great but I need more. I need the *source code* of the organization. I need the EABs, the full technical specs, the raw data. Don't hide it behind a 'Read More' button. Give me the full text, but make it readable."
*   **Consolidation Strategy**: Merge `page_concept_user_stories.md`, `page_concept_eab_template.md`, `page_concept_entity_expansion_psychohistory.md`, and `page_concept_hierarchical_property_full.md` into a monumental "Living Library."

## 2. Core Concept: "The Alexandria of Cyber"
This page is for the deep reader. It respects the user's intelligence by providing the *complete* text of critical documents, but wraps them in a "Scrollytelling" interface that makes them a joy to consume.

## 3. The "Wow" Visualization
**The Infinite Scroll of Knowledge**
*   **Visual**: A "Minority Report" style document interface.
*   **Interaction**:
    *   **The Spine**: A persistent left-hand navigation rail that tracks your reading progress through massive documents.
    *   **The Living Text**: Code blocks are interactive (you can run them). Diagrams are animated.
    *   **The EAB Vault**: A section dedicated to the "Express Attack Briefs."

## 4. Key Narrative & Copy
*   **Headline**: "Intelligence Without Abstraction."
*   **Sub-headline**: "Full-Text Access to User Stories, EABs, and Technical Specifications."
*   **Body Copy**: "Summary is the enemy of nuance. The AEON Codex provides unredacted, full-text access to the foundational documents of the platform. From the 200+ Express Attack Briefs (EABs) to the raw mathematical proofs of the McKenney-Lacan Calculus, everything is here. Read the source."

## 5. Integrated Features
*   **The EAB Reader**: (From EAB Template) A specialized view for reading the 40+ (soon to be 200+) Express Attack Briefs. It formats them like high-end magazine articles.
*   **The Spec Viewer**: (From Hierarchical Property Full) A technical view for schema documents, with syntax highlighting and graph visualizations.
*   **The User Story Map**: (From User Stories) A visual map connecting user stories to the features they spawned.

## 6. Technical Implementation
*   **Stack**: React + MDX (Markdown with JSX) + Framer Motion.
*   **Performance**: Virtualized scrolling is essential here due to the massive text volume.
