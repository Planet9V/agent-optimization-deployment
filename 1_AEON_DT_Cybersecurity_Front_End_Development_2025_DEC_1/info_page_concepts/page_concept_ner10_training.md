# Page Concept: The Mind Reader (NER10)
**"Teaching AI to Understand Psychology"**

## 1. Core Concept
A visualization of the **NER10 Model** in action. It demonstrates how the system reads unstructured text (emails, reports) and extracts hidden psychological signals (biases, fears, motivations).

## 2. Visual Design (The "Neural Decoder")
*   **Style**: "Matrix-style" text rain, glowing entity highlights, neural network connections.
*   **Interaction**: "Live Scanning" simulation.

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 The Live Scanner
*   **Visual**: A stream of scrolling text (e.g., a CISO's email).
*   **Action**: The AI highlights words in real-time.
    *   "We've never been breached" -> **[NORMALCY_BIAS]** (Red)
    *   "Nation-state actors" -> **[IMAGINARY_THREAT]** (Purple)
    *   "Budget constraints" -> **[RATIONALIZATION]** (Orange)

### 3.2 The Entity Cloud
*   **Visual**: A 3D rotating cloud of the 566 entity types.
*   **Categories**:
    *   **Cognitive Biases**: Normalcy, Availability, Confirmation.
    *   **Emotions**: Anxiety, Panic, Denial.
    *   **Motivations**: Money, Ideology, Ego (MICE).
*   **Message**: "We track the Human Operating System."

### 3.3 The Training Loop
*   **Visual**: A flow diagram showing "Raw Text" -> "NER10 Extraction" -> "Neo4j Graph" -> "Prediction".
*   **Stat**: "Trained on 500+ examples per entity type. 92% Accuracy."

## 4. Technical Implementation
*   **Data Source**: `PSYCHOHISTORY_NER10_TRAINING_SPEC.md`.
*   **Visuals**: Text highlighting libraries, 3D tag cloud.

## 5. Business Value
*   **"Magic"**: Shows the "Secret Sauce" of how the system understands human behavior.
*   **"Depth"**: Proves we aren't just looking at keywords, but deep psychological constructs.
*   **"Differentiation"**: No other security tool extracts "Cognitive Biases" from text.
