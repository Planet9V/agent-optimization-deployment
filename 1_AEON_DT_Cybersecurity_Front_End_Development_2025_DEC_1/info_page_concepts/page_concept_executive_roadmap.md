# Page Concept: The Executive Roadmap
**"From Reaction to Prediction"**

## 1. Core Concept
A strategic, board-level dashboard that translates complex psychohistory physics into clear **Business Intelligence**. It tracks the organization's "Psychohistory Readiness" and provides a high-level timeline of predicted "Phase Transitions" (Crises).

## 2. Visual Design (The "War Room")
*   **Style**: Clean, minimalist, high-contrast. "Glassmorphism" panels over a dark, abstract background. Less "Matrix", more "Minority Report" interface.
*   **The Timeline**: A horizontal, scrolling timeline spanning "Past", "Present", and "Future (90 Days)".
*   **The "Defcon" Gauge**: A prominent, central gauge showing the current **Global Risk Level** (derived from System Energy).

## 3. Key Features & Interactions

### 3.1 The "Phase Transition" Alert System
*   **Visual**: On the timeline, future "Seldon Crises" are marked as glowing **Bifurcation Points**.
*   **Interaction**: Click on a point to see the "Crisis Dossier":
    *   **Probability**: "85%"
    *   **Sector**: "Finance / SWIFT"
    *   **Cause**: "Critical Slowing Down detected in Log4j patching."

### 3.2 Readiness Level Indicators
*   **Visual**: 5 Circular Gauges corresponding to the **Psychohistory Readiness Matrix** (Level 1-5).
    *   **Data (NER11)**: 5/5 (Full Ring)
    *   **Topology (Neo4j)**: 5/5 (Full Ring)
    *   **Dynamics (Swarm)**: 2/5 (Partial Ring)
*   **Animation**: The rings "fill up" as the system ingests more data.

### 3.3 The "Strategic Roadmap" Gantt
*   **Visual**: A breakdown of the 4 Phases (Foundation, Integration, Simulation, Control).
*   **Status**: Live tracking of milestones (e.g., "NER11 F1 Score: 92%").

## 4. Technical Implementation
*   **Data Source**: `10_EXECUTIVE_SYNTHESIS_AND_ROADMAP.md`.
*   **Backend**: Aggregates status from all other microservices.
*   **Visualization**:
    *   **D3.js / Recharts**: For precise, clean charts and timelines.
    *   **Framer Motion**: For smooth, premium transitions between states.

## 5. Business Value
*   **"C-Suite Ready"**: Speaks the language of risk and timeline, not code.
*   **"Justification"**: Visually demonstrates *why* budget is needed (to fill the Readiness rings).
*   **"Clarity"**: Cuts through the noise to show the "One Big Thing" that matters (The next Crisis).
