# Page Concept: The 6-Level Architecture
**"The Complete Stack: From Metal to Mind"**

## 1. Core Concept
A vertical, interactive "elevator ride" through the 6 levels of the AEON architecture. It demonstrates how a physical asset (Level 0) connects to a psychological prediction (Level 6).

## 2. Visual Design (The "Glass Elevator")
*   **The Stack**: A 3D transparent skyscraper with 6 distinct floors.
*   **Navigation**: User scrolls to "ascend" from the basement (Hardware) to the penthouse (Prediction).
*   **Data Flow**: Glowing data streams flow *up* (Reality → Prediction) and *down* (Intervention → Action).

## 3. The Levels (Floors)

### Level 0: The Foundation (Equipment Taxonomy)
*   **Visual**: A vast warehouse of holographic blueprints.
*   **Concept**: "The Reference Architecture."
*   **Interaction**: Hover over a "Cisco ASA" blueprint to see it instantiated across 16 sectors.

### Level 1: The Fleet (Equipment Instances)
*   **Visual**: A spinning globe showing 2,014 live deployments.
*   **Concept**: "Your Specific Reality."
*   **Interaction**: Click "LA Water Plant" to zoom into a specific firewall.

### Level 2: The Anatomy (SBOM & Software)
*   **Visual**: An "X-Ray" view of the firewall, revealing the software code and libraries inside.
*   **Concept**: "The DNA of Risk."
*   **Detail**: Highlight "OpenSSL 1.0.2k" glowing red (Vulnerable).

### Level 3: The Threat (Attack Paths)
*   **Visual**: Red "laser beams" (Attack Paths) attempting to penetrate the X-Ray.
*   **Concept**: "The Kill Chain."
*   **Detail**: Show APT29 using "T1190" to exploit the OpenSSL library.

### Level 4: The Mind (Psychology & Culture)
*   **Visual**: A "Brain Scan" overlay on the organization.
*   **Concept**: "The Human Element."
*   **Detail**: "Normalcy Bias" clouding the decision to patch. "Risk Aversion" delaying action by 180 days.

### Level 5: The Context (Events & Geopolitics)
*   **Visual**: A "Newsroom" ticker and global tension heat map surrounding the building.
*   **Concept**: "The World Stage."
*   **Detail**: "Geopolitical Tension: High" amplifies the threat level.

### Level 6: The Oracle (Prediction & Psychohistory)
*   **Visual**: A holographic "Future Cone" projecting 90 days out.
*   **Concept**: "The Future Revealed."
*   **Prediction**: "89% Probability of Breach in 45 Days."
*   **Intervention**: "Patch Now = 4,100% ROI."

## 4. Technical Implementation
*   **Data Source**: `6_LEVEL_ARCHITECTURE_EXPLAINED.md`.
*   **Visuals**: Three.js for the skyscraper/elevator effect.
*   **Data Binding**: Neo4j queries fetching live counts for each level.

## 5. Business Value
*   **"Depth"**: Proves AEON goes deeper than any competitor (Library level + Psych level).
*   **"Logic"**: Visually explains *why* the prediction works (it's not magic, it's data).
*   **"differentiation"**: Shows the "Moat" – competitors might have Level 3, but none have Level 4-6.
