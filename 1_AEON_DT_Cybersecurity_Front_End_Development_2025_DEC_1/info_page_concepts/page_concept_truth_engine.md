# Page Concept: The Truth Engine (Wiki vs. Database)

## 1. Core Concept
**"The Mirror That Does Not Lie."**
This page addresses the "Organizational Truth" gap by visualizing **Enhancement E06b (Wiki Truth Correction)** and **Enhancement E19 (Blind Spots)**. It is the most confrontational page in the system. It takes the "Corporate Wiki" (the stories we tell ourselves) and holds it up against the "Graph Database" (the mathematical reality).

## 2. The "Wow" Visualization
**The Reality Diff**
*   **Visual Metaphor**: A split-screen "Code Diff" interface, but for organizational knowledge.
*   **Left Side ("The Myth")**: A document that looks like a Confluence/Wiki page. It is blurry, slightly yellowed, and full of comforting lies. "We have 537,000 secure assets."
*   **Right Side ("The Truth")**: A sharp, high-contrast Neo4j graph visualization. "Actual Assets: 29,774."
*   **The Interaction**:
    *   **The Scan**: A laser line scans down the page.
    *   **The Glitch**: When the laser hits a lie on the Left, the text glitches and turns red.
    *   **The Correction**: A connector line shoots from the Right side, overwriting the lie with the hard data. "Correction Applied: 94% Overstatement Detected."

## 3. Key Narrative & Copy
*   **Headline**: "The Map is Not the Territory."
*   **Sub-headline**: "Automated Truth Verification: Wiki vs. Reality."
*   **Body Copy**: "Organizations die from the lies they tell themselves. 'Our perimeter is secure.' 'Our inventory is complete.' AEON's Truth Engine crawls your internal documentation and validates every claim against the ground truth of the digital twin. We don't just find bugs in code; we find bugs in your reality."

## 4. Key Math / Intellectual IP
*   **The Truth Score**: $T = \frac{Verified\_Claims}{Total\_Claims}$
*   **The Delusion Index**: A metric quantifying the gap between perceived and actual security posture.
*   **Lacanian Mirror Stage**: Visualizing the moment the organization recognizes its "Ideal I" (Wiki) is a fiction.

## 5. User Experience (UX) Flow
1.  **The Confrontation**: The page opens with a "Truth Score: 42%". It is shocking.
2.  **The Evidence**: User clicks "View Discrepancies."
3.  **The Drill Down**:
    *   **Claim**: "All PLCs are air-gapped."
    *   **Reality**: "14 PLCs have active cellular modems."
    *   **Evidence**: A direct link to the Shodan scan result.
4.  **The Remediation**: User clicks "Sync Reality." The Wiki is updated. The Truth Score rises.

## 6. Innovation Factor
*   **Psychological Impact**: This is not just a dashboard; it is an intervention. It uses the visual language of "Diff Tools" (which engineers trust) to solve "Political Problems" (which engineers hate).
*   **Automated Governance**: Visualizing the concept of "Living Documentation" that heals itself.

## 7. Technical Implementation
*   **Framework**: React + Monaco Editor (for the diff view) + D3.js (for the graph).
*   **Data Source**: Wiki API (Confluence) + Neo4j Database.
*   **Performance**: CSS transforms for the "Glitch" effects to ensure 60fps performance.
