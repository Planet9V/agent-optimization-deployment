# Page Concept: The Population Forecast (Mass Psychohistory)

## 1. Core Concept
**"The Weather Channel for Cyber Risk."**
This page addresses the "Population Scale" gap by visualizing **Enhancement E23 (Population Event Forecasting)**. It fulfills the core "Asimov" promise: while you cannot predict the individual, you *can* predict the mass. It shifts the focus from "Incidents" to "Susceptibility," showing risk as a shifting climate rather than a series of lightning strikes.

## 2. The "Wow" Visualization
**The Human Vulnerability Heatmap**
*   **Visual Metaphor**: A stunning, dark-mode 3D globe (or detailed national map) that looks like a high-end meteorological forecast.
*   **Data Layers**: Instead of "Precipitation" or "Wind," the layers are:
    *   **Phishing Susceptibility**: Based on age demographics and tech adoption.
    *   **Ransomware Targetability**: Based on hospital/school density and municipal budget cycles.
    *   **Social Engineering Pressure**: Based on economic stress indicators (unemployment, inflation).
*   **Interaction**: The user can "scrub" through time. "Show me the forecast for Q4 2025." A storm front of "High Vulnerability" moves across the Midwest as economic indicators dip.

## 3. Key Narrative & Copy
*   **Headline**: "We Don't Predict the Hack. We Predict the Panic."
*   **Sub-headline**: "Mass Psychohistory and Population-Scale Threat Modeling."
*   **Body Copy**: "A single user clicking a link is chaos. Ten million users facing economic stress and outdated infrastructure is a statistical certainty. AEON's Population Forecast engine ingests demographic, economic, and technological census data to map the 'Vulnerability Density' of entire nations. We tell you where the storm will hit before the first packet is sent."

## 4. Key Math / Intellectual IP
*   **The Population Integral**: $S_{pop} = \iiint \rho(x,y,z,t) \cdot V(x,y,z,t) \cdot M(x,y,z,t) \,dx\,dy\,dz$
    *   Where $\rho$ is population density, $V$ is vulnerability, and $M$ is motivation.
*   **Variance Reduction**: $\sigma_{pop} = \frac{\sigma_{ind}}{\sqrt{N}}$ (Proving that larger populations are *more* predictable).
*   **Visual Implementation**: These equations are rendered as "Meteorological Models" in the sidebar, giving scientific weight to the map.

## 5. User Experience (UX) Flow
1.  **The Global View**: The page opens with the spinning globe. "Global Risk Index: Moderate."
2.  **The Drill Down**: User zooms into a specific region (e.g., "The Rust Belt").
3.  **The Layer Select**: User toggles "Healthcare Sector" + "Ransomware Risk."
4.  **The Insight**: The map glows red over specific counties. A tooltip explains: "High concentration of legacy medical devices + aging IT workforce = 89% Probability of Breach in Q3."
5.  **The Action**: "Deploy Defensive Resources." The user drags a "Shield" icon to the region, and the red glow recedes.

## 6. Innovation Factor
*   **Demographic Cybersecurity**: Moving beyond technical indicators (IP addresses) to sociological indicators (Age, Economy, Culture).
*   **Predictive Mapping**: Visualizing risk as a *future state* based on slow-moving demographic trends, rather than a *past state* based on fast-moving logs.

## 7. Technical Implementation
*   **Framework**: React + Mapbox GL JS (or Globe.gl).
*   **Data Source**: US Census Data API + GDELT (Global Events) + AEON Threat Intel.
*   **Performance**: WebGL for rendering millions of data points as a heat surface.
