# Page Concept: The AEON Vision (Investor Long Scroll)
**"Predict the Future. Prevent the Breach."**

## 1. Core Concept
A "Neverending" Parallax Scrolling Landing Page designed to be the ultimate sales pitch for AEON. It takes the investor on a journey from the chaos of reactive security to the clarity of **Psychohistory**. It is visually stunning, data-rich, and emotionally compelling.

## 2. Visual Design (The "Time Tunnel")
*   **The Scroll**: As the user scrolls down, they are effectively "traveling forward in time."
*   **Background**: Starts as a chaotic, red-tinted "Reactive" world. As you scroll, it transitions to a calm, blue/gold "Predictive" future.
*   **Typography**: Cinematic, high-contrast, "Apple-style" product reveal.

## 3. The Narrative Journey (Sections)

### Section 1: The Hook ("The Reactive Trap")
*   **Visual**: A ticking clock counting *up* (Time since breach).
*   **Headline**: "By the time you see the alert, it's already too late."

### Section 2: The Paradigm Shift ("Enter Psychohistory")

### Section 3: The Secret Sauce ("The Lacanian Framework")
*   **Visual**: The Borromean Knot (Real, Symbolic, Imaginary) rotating in 3D.
*   **Headline**: "We decode the Human Element."
*   **Explanation**: "Attackers are human. Defenders are human. We model the psychology, not just the code."
*   **Proof**: "McKenney's Vision: 92/100 Fulfillment Score."

### Section 5: The ROI ("150x Return")
