# Page Concept: The GGNN Calculus (Lacanian Topology)
**"The Morphogenesis of the Signifying Chain"**

## 1. Core Concept
A visualization of the **Lacanian Gated Graph Neural Network (L-gGNN)**. This is the most abstract and theoretical page, visualizing the "Unconscious" of the AI. It shows how the **Four Discourses** (Master, University, Hysteric, Analyst) process information and how "Personality" (Big 5) acts as the gating mechanism for the neural net.

## 2. Visual Design (The "Borromean Knot")
*   **The Structure**: The central visual is NOT a standard neural net. It is a **Tetrahedral Graph** representing the 4 Positions (Agent, Other, Product, Truth).
*   **The Flow**: "Signifiers" (Vectors) flow along the edges.
    *   **$S_1$**: Rigid, golden beams (Master Signifiers).
    *   **$a$**: Chaotic, smoky trails (Object *a* / Entropy).
    *   **$S_2$**: Dense, woven meshes (Knowledge).
    *   **$\$$**: Flickering, broken lines (The Barred Subject).

## 3. Key Features & Interactions

### 3.1 The "Quarter Turn" Animation
*   **Control**: A dial to rotate the discourse.
*   **Effect**: As you turn the dial, the positions of the Mathemes ($S_1, S_2, \$, a$) shift.
    *   **Master $\to$ University**: The "Golden Beam" ($S_1$) moves to the Truth position. The "Mesh" ($S_2$) takes the Agent position.
    *   **Visual**: The entire flow of the network changes direction. "Repression" barriers appear/disappear.

### 3.2 The "Personality Tuner" (Cybernetic Big 5)
*   **Controls**: Sliders for **O, C, E, A, N**.
*   **Effect**: Changing the sliders modifies the **Gating Mechanisms** of the nodes.
    *   **High N (Neuroticism)**: The nodes start vibrating. The "Reset Gate" flickers. The flow becomes turbulent.
    *   **High C (Conscientiousness)**: The flow becomes rigid, straight, and efficient (but brittle).

### 3.3 The "Scansion" Detector (Catastrophe Theory)
*   **Visual**: A 3D surface plot (The **Cusp Catastrophe** manifold).
*   **Action**: A ball rolls along the surface.
*   **The Cut**: When the ball hits the "Fold" (Bifurcation), the simulation **FREEZES** (The Cut). A "Session Ended" overlay appears with the "Interpretation".

## 4. Technical Implementation
*   **Data Source**: `Simulating Calculus with GGNN.md`.
*   **Backend**: PyTorch / GNN model visualization.
*   **Visualization**:
    *   **Three.js**: For the Knot and the Catastrophe surface.
    *   **ShaderMaterial**: For the "Smoky" Object *a* effects.

## 5. Business Value
*   **"Differentiation"**: No other security company talks about "Lacanian Topology." It proves AEON is playing a completely different game.
*   **"Human AI"**: Shows that the AI understands *human* factors (Personality, Discourse), not just code.
*   **"Deep Theory"**: Establishes the "Chef" as a profound intellect, building trust in its high-level judgments.
