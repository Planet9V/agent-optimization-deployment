# Page Concept: The Calculus of Desire
**"The Math of the Unconscious"**

## 1. Core Concept
A stark, academic, yet beautiful visualization of the mathematical formulas that underpin Psychohistory. It treats the equations as art, visualizing the variables (Real, Symbolic, Imaginary) as interacting fields.

## 2. Visual Design (The "Blackboard")
*   **Style**: Minimalist, dark grey background, chalk-white equations.
*   **Metaphor**: "The Professor's Mind".

## 3. The Equations

### The Borromean Knot (Stability)
*   **Visual**: A 3D rotating Borromean Knot.
*   **Interaction**: Adjust the "Symbolic" ring size. If it gets too small, the knot falls apart (Crisis).
*   **Equation**: `det|R S I| ≠ 0`.

### The Dyad (Attacker vs Defender)
*   **Visual**: Two orbiting spheres (Attacker, Defender).
*   **Interaction**: As they get closer (Reality Gap shrinks), the "Coupling Strength" (Lambda) spikes.
*   **Equation**: `Λ(d,a) = (Ψ_d ⊗ Ψ_a) / |R_d - R_a|²`.

### The Crisis Prediction (The Wave)
*   **Visual**: A probability wave propagating forward in time.
*   **Highlight**: A red spike indicates a "Seldon Crisis" in 90 days.

## 4. Technical Implementation
*   **Data Source**: `Enhancement_26_McKenney_Lacan_Calculus/README.md`.
*   **Visuals**: LaTeX rendering for math, WebGL for the 3D knot.

## 5. Innovation Factor
*   **"Elegance"**: Makes complex calculus look beautiful and approachable.
*   **"Interactive Math"**: Users learn the formula by playing with the variables.
*   **"Foundational"**: Establishes the scientific rigor behind the platform.
