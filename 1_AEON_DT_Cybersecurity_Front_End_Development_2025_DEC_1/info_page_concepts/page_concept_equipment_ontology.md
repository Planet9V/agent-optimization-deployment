# Page Concept: The Ontology Engine
**"One Truth, Infinite Context"**

## 1. Core Concept
A visualization of the "Graph Schema" itself, demonstrating the elegance of the Multi-Level Ontology. It proves how AEON handles scale (16 sectors) without duplication.

## 2. Visual Design (The "Neural Web")
*   **Central Node**: The "Canonical Product" (e.g., Cisco ASA 5500).
*   **Radial Connections**: Thousands of "Instance Nodes" radiating out like spokes on a wheel.
*   **Sectors**: The instances are grouped into colored clusters (Water = Blue, Energy = Yellow).
*   **Animation**: "Pulse" the central node to see the impact ripple out to all 16 sectors instantly.

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 The "20-Hop" Traversal
*   **Visual**: A "Wormhole" animation.
*   **Journey**: Start at "Predictive Model" (Hop 20) and fly backwards through the 20 hops to the "Equipment Product" (Hop 1).
*   **Message**: "Deep Context." Most tools stop at 2 hops. We go 20.

### 3.2 The "Anti-Duplication" Proof
*   **Visual**: A split screen comparison.
*   **Left (Competitor)**: 16 separate "Cisco ASA" nodes, disconnected. Messy.
*   **Right (AEON)**: 1 clean "Cisco ASA" node, connected to everything. Elegant.
*   **Metric**: "94% Storage Reduction. 1000% Intelligence Gain."

### 3.3 The "Cross-Sector" Insight
*   **Visual**: A map of the US.
*   **Action**: Select "CVE-2024-1234".
*   **Effect**: Simultaneously light up affected assets in Water (LA), Healthcare (Chicago), and Energy (Texas).
*   **Insight**: "Sector Interdependency."

## 4. Technical Implementation
*   **Data Source**: `MULTI_LEVEL_EQUIPMENT_ONTOLOGY.md`.
*   **Visuals**: WebGL (Regl) for handling thousands of nodes in the "Neural Web."

## 5. Business Value
*   **"Scalability"**: Proves the system can handle the entire US critical infrastructure.
*   **"Intelligence"**: Shows that learning from one sector (Water) instantly protects another (Energy).
*   **"Architecture"**: Appeals to CTOs/Architects who value elegant data design.
