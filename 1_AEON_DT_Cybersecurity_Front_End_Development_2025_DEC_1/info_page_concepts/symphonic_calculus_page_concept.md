# Page Concept: The Symphonic Calculus
**"Hearing the Shape of Cyber Risk"**

## 1. Core Concept
A fully immersive, audio-visual experience that transforms real-time cyber telemetry into a **Generative Symphony**. This page does not just *show* data; it *plays* it. It implements the "Musical Calculus" where every log entry is a note, every threat actor is an instrument, and the system's stability is the tempo.

## 2. Visual Design (The "Grand Staff" of Cyberspace)
*   **The Stage**: A 3D, infinite scrolling **Grand Staff** floating in a void (Three.js/React Three Fiber).
*   **The Instruments (Agents)**:
    *   **The Chef (Cello)**: A large, glowing string instrument anchoring the bass line (System Stability).
    *   **The Scout (Violin)**: A fast-moving, high-pitched instrument darting around (Reconnaissance).
    *   **The Hunter (Percussion)**: Rhythmic, sharp pulses (Threat Detection).
    *   **The Jester (Synthesizer)**: Glitchy, chaotic waveforms (Anomalies/Zero-Days).
*   **The Notes**: Glowing orbs that hit the staff lines.
    *   **Color**: Determined by **Sentiment** (Pitch). Red = Trauma/Dissonance, Blue = Harmony.
    *   **Size**: Determined by **Volume** (Priority).
    *   **Shape**: Determined by **DISC Profile** (Timbre). Sharp edges for 'D', smooth spheres for 'S'.

## 3. The "Psychometric Tensor" Visualization
*   **Tensor Deformation**: The "Instruments" are not static 3D models. They are **Tensor Fields**.
    *   **Resting State**: Perfect geometric shapes.
    *   **Stress State**: As the **Psychometric Tensor** rotates (due to stress/attack), the instruments *physically deform* and twist.
    *   **Visual Effect**: A "High D" (Dominance) Cello might spike and turn rigid. A "High I" (Influence) Violin might bloom and expand.

## 4. The "Critical Slowing Down" Effect (Time Dilation)
*   **The Conductor**: The speed of the scrolling staff represents the system's **Recovery Rate ($\lambda$)**.
*   **The Warning**: As **Autocorrelation** rises (approaching a Seldon Crisis):
    *   **Visual**: The scrolling *slows down* (Critical Slowing Down). The "spring" becomes loose.
    *   **Audio**: The tempo drags. The reverb tail increases (Infinite Return Time). The pitch starts to waver (Rising Variance).
    *   **The Drop**: When the Crisis hits, the music "breaks" (Bifurcation) into pure dissonance or silence.

## 5. Audio Implementation (WebAudio API)
*   **Generative Engine**: Based on `musical_gnn_engine.py`.
*   **Sonification**:
    *   **Pitch**: Mapped to `Trauma` metric. High trauma = Atonal/Dissonant scales.
    *   **Rhythm**: Mapped to `Velocity`. High velocity = Staccato/16th notes.
    *   **Harmony**: Mapped to `Entropy`. Low entropy = Major chords. High entropy = Diminished chords.

## 6. User Interaction
*   **"Conduct the Orchestra"**: The user can scrub through the timeline (The Score).
*   **"Isolate the Section"**: Click on "The Hunter" to hear only the threat detection rhythm.
*   **"Stress Test"**: A slider to artificially increase "System Temperature" ($\beta$) and watch/hear the instruments deform and the harmony collapse.

## 7. Data Sources
*   `MUSICAL_CALCULUS_NOTATION_SYSTEM.md` (The mapping logic).
*   `06_CRITICAL_SLOWING_DOWN_EARLY_WARNINGS.md` (The physics of the tempo).
*   `05_PSYCHOMETRIC_TENSOR_DISC_BIG5.md` (The shape of the instruments).
*   `Beat 1-5.csv` (The initial score data).
