# Page Concept: The McKenney Protocol
**"8 Questions That Define Survival"**

## 1. Core Concept
An **"Endless" Parallax Scrolling Journey** that takes the user through Jim McKenney's 8 Critical Intelligence Questions. It is a narrative experience, moving from simple discovery to advanced prediction.

## 2. Visual Design (The "Descent into Truth")
*   **Structure**: A single, long vertical page. No page reloads.
*   **Navigation**: A sticky "Progress Bar" on the left tracking Q1 to Q8.
*   **Transitions**: Smooth fades, zooms, and data visualizations that assemble as you scroll.

## 3. The Journey (The 8 Blocks)

### Block 1: The Inventory (Q1 & Q2)
*   **Question**: *"What exists?"*
*   **Visual**: A spinning globe that resolves into a map of the user's infrastructure.
*   **Data**: "48,100 Devices Discovered." "16 Sectors Mapped."
*   **Insight**: "You can't defend what you can't see."

### Block 2: The Vulnerability (Q3)
*   **Question**: *"What is vulnerable?"*
*   **Visual**: The map turns into a heatmap. Red dots appear on specific assets.
*   **Data**: "316,000 CVEs Analyzed." "1,240 Critical."
*   **Insight**: "It's not just about counting bugs. It's about context."

### Block 3: The Threat (Q4)
*   **Question**: *"Who is targeting us?"*
*   **Visual**: Silhouettes of Threat Actors (APT29, Lazarus) connecting to the vulnerable assets.
*   **Data**: "APT33 targeting Energy Sector." "T1190 Technique Detected."
*   **Insight**: "Know your enemy."

### Block 4: The Psychology (Q5 & Q6)
*   **Question**: *"What are the human factors?"*
*   **Visual**: A "Brain Scan" overlay.
*   **Data**: "Normalcy Bias Detected in Water Sector." "Phishing Susceptibility: High."
*   **Insight**: "The biggest vulnerability isn't code. It's culture."

### Block 5: The Prediction (Q7)
*   **Question**: *"What will happen next?"*
*   **Visual**: A timeline extending into the future (The "Future Cone").
*   **Data**: "89% Probability of Breach in 45 Days."
*   **Insight**: "Don't just react. Predict."

### Block 6: The Decision (Q8)
*   **Question**: *"What should we do?"*
*   **Visual**: A "Fork in the Road."
    *   Path A: "Do Nothing" -> Cost: $75M.
    *   Path B: "Patch Now" -> Cost: $500K.
*   **Data**: "ROI: 150x."
*   **Insight**: "Security is an investment, not a cost."

## 4. Technical Implementation
*   **Data Source**: `MCKENNEY_QUESTIONS_GUIDE.md`.
*   **Visuals**: ScrollMagic or GSAP for the scroll-triggered animations.
*   **Content**: "Executive Briefing" style copy – punchy, high-stakes.

## 5. Business Value
*   **"Completeness"**: Shows that AEON covers the *entire* spectrum of cybersecurity needs.
*   **"Storytelling"**: Turns dry requirements into a compelling narrative of survival.
*   **"Alignment"**: Directly honors the vision of Jim McKenney, proving we built exactly what was asked.
