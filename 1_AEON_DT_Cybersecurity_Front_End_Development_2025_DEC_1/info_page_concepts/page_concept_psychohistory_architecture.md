# Page Concept: The Blueprint of Prediction
**"Architecture as Art"**

## 1. Core Concept
An interactive, explorable blueprint of the entire Psychohistory system, based on the C4 Model. It allows technical stakeholders to "zoom in" from the 50,000ft view (Context) down to the code level (Component).

## 2. Visual Design (The "Living Blueprint")
*   **Style**: Dark mode, neon blue schematics, grid lines, "CAD-style" interface.
*   **Navigation**: A "Zoom Slider" on the right (Context -> Container -> Component -> Code).
*   **Animation**: Data packets flowing through the lines of the diagram.

## 3. The Views (Zoom Levels)

### Level 1: System Context (The Ecosystem)
*   **Visual**: Central "Psychohistory System" node surrounded by "Threat Analysts", "Board", "External Feeds".
*   **Interaction**: Hover over "External Feeds" to see live data sources (NVD, CISA, Reuters).

### Level 2: Containers (The Machinery)
*   **Visual**: Exploded view of the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Key Components**: React Frontend, Node.js API, Neo4j Graph, Prediction Engine.
*   **Highlight**: The "Dual-Brain" connection between Neo4j (Structure) and Qdrant (Context).

### Level 3: Components (The Engine)
*   **Visual**: Inside the "Prediction Engine" container.
*   **Subsystems**: "Pattern Recognition", "Behavioral Modeling", "Geopolitical Correlation".
*   **Action**: Simulate a "Prediction Request" and watch it light up the specific components involved.

### Level 4: Code (The Logic)
*   **Visual**: A sequence diagram coming to life.
*   **Flow**: Query Service → Org Psychology → Vulnerability Data → Composite Probability Calculation.

## 4. Technical Implementation
*   **Data Source**: `PSYCHOHISTORY_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md`.
*   **Visuals**: React Flow or Mermaid.js rendered with custom CSS for the "Blueprint" look.

## 5. Business Value
*   **"Trust"**: Shows the system is robust, well-architected, and production-ready.
*   **"Transparency"**: Removes the "Black Box" fear of AI by showing exactly how it works.
*   **"Credibility"**: Appeals to the CISO and Chief Architect who need to sign off on the tech.
