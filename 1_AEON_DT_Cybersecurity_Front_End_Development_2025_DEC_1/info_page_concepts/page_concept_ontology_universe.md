# Page Concept: The Ontology Universe
**"The Infinite Library of Things"**

## 1. Core Concept
An "Infinite Zoom" interface that visualizes the 6-level equipment ontology not as a list, but as a vast, interconnected universe. Users start at the "Sector" level and can zoom continuously down to the "Software Component" level, traversing the 20-hop relationships seamlessly.

## 2. Visual Design (The "Interstellar" Library)
*   **Style**: Cinematic, deep space background, glowing constellations of data.
*   **Navigation**: Scroll to zoom. No clicks required. The camera flies through the nodes.
*   **Metaphor**: "As above, so below." The macro (Sector) reflects the micro (Component).

## 3. The Journey (Zoom Levels)

### Level 1: The Constellations (Sectors)
*   **Visual**: 16 massive star clusters representing the Critical Infrastructure Sectors.
*   **Interaction**: Hovering shows the "Mass" (Total Assets) and "Gravity" (Risk Score).

### Level 2: The Solar Systems (Facilities)
*   **Visual**: Zooming into "Energy" reveals thousands of "Facility" suns.
*   **Detail**: Each facility orbits with its specific metadata (Location, Owner).

### Level 3: The Planets (Systems)
*   **Visual**: Inside a facility, "Systems" (SCADA, HVAC, Safety) orbit like planets.
*   **Highlight**: The "Safety Instrumented System" planet glows red if vulnerable.

### Level 4: The Cities (Equipment)
*   **Visual**: On the surface of a planet, "Equipment" (PLCs, Pumps) appear as complex cities.
*   **Detail**: The "Equipment Product" (Template) vs "Equipment Instance" (Real) distinction is shown as a "Blueprint" overlaying the "Building".

### Level 5: The Buildings (Components)
*   **Visual**: Inside a PLC city, "Cards" and "Modules" are individual buildings.

### Level 6: The Code (Software)
*   **Visual**: Zooming into a window reveals the "Software" running inside—lines of code, libraries, SBOMs.
*   **The Reveal**: A "Vulnerability" is a glitch in the matrix, pulsing at this microscopic level.

## 4. Technical Implementation
*   **Data Source**: `MULTI_LEVEL_EQUIPMENT_ONTOLOGY.md`.
*   **Visuals**: Three.js or React Three Fiber.
*   **Performance**: Level-of-Detail (LOD) rendering to handle thousands of nodes.

## 5. Innovation Factor
*   **"Scale"**: Visually demonstrates the sheer scale of the Digital Twin (29,000+ nodes).
*   **"Context"**: Shows how a tiny library bug (Level 6) exists within a massive sector (Level 1).
*   **"Beauty"**: Turns dry inventory data into a stunning visual experience.
