# Page Concept: AEON Subminds
**"The Neural Assembly"**

## 1. Core Concept
A single, "Endless Scroll" landing page that introduces the "AEON Subminds"—the specialized AI agents that power the Digital Twin. The page feels like descending into a deep underground facility or traversing a neural network, where each "floor" or "node" reveals a new specialist agent.

## 2. Visual Design (The "Silo" Descent)
*   **Style**: Dark, cinematic, high-tech.
*   **Navigation**: Vertical scroll. As you scroll, the background parallax shifts, giving the sensation of depth.
*   **Metaphor**: "Meeting the Team" (but the team is AI).

## 3. The Subminds (The Scroll Blocks)

### Block 1: The Architect (Neo4j Schema Architect)
*   **Visual**: A massive, rotating 3D graph structure (the schema) forming around a central core.
*   **Capability**: "Constructs the reality of the Digital Twin. Defines the ontology of 10,000+ assets."
*   **Purpose**: Ensures the structural integrity of the knowledge graph.

### Block 2: The Cartographer (Knowledge Graph Schema Architect)
*   **Visual**: A holographic map being drawn in real-time, connecting disparate data points.
*   **Capability**: "Maps the chaos of industrial infrastructure into structured knowledge."
*   **Purpose**: Translates physical assets into digital nodes.

### Block 3: The Mathematician (Graph Algorithm Specialist)
*   **Visual**: Cascading equations and probability waves flowing like a waterfall.
*   **Capability**: "Calculates the 'Edge Cascading Failure' probability in sub-seconds."
*   **Purpose**: Predicts the ripple effects of a single component failure.

### Block 4: The Bridge Builder (API Integration Specialist)
*   **Visual**: Thousands of glowing fiber-optic cables connecting a central hub to external "Vendor" islands (Siemens, Rockwell).
*   **Capability**: "Speaks every language. Translates REST, MQTT, and OPC-UA into pure insight."
*   **Purpose**: Unifies fragmented industrial protocols.

### Block 5: The Sentinel (Compliance & Threat Modeling Specialist)
*   **Visual**: A scanning laser grid (The Shield) passing over the infrastructure.
*   **Capability**: "Enforces the Law (IEC 62443). Detects the unseen threats."
*   **Purpose**: Ensures safety, security, and regulatory compliance.

### Block 6: The Mirror (Digital Twin Specialist)
*   **Visual**: A split screen. Left is "Physical" (gritty, real), Right is "Digital" (wireframe, perfect). They move in perfect sync.
*   **Capability**: "Maintains the perfect reflection of reality."
*   **Purpose**: Real-time synchronization of the physical and digital worlds.

### Block 7: The Translator (SCADA Integration Specialist)
*   **Visual**: A retro-futuristic console decoding raw binary streams from PLCs into human-readable alerts.
*   **Capability**: "Listens to the heartbeat of the machines (100ms frequency)."
*   **Purpose**: Ingests high-frequency operational data.

### Block 8: The Explorer (Research Specialist)
*   **Visual**: A swarm of tiny drones (agents) flying out into the "Unknown" (internet/docs) and returning with data crystals.
*   **Capability**: "Hunts for new knowledge. Expands the collective intelligence."
*   **Purpose**: Continuous learning and adaptation.

### Block 9: The Engineer (Technical Implementation Specialist)
*   **Visual**: A blueprint coming to life, assembling itself into a working engine.
*   **Capability**: "Turns theory into code. Builds the industrial implementation patterns."
*   **Purpose**: Practical execution of theoretical models.

## 4. Technical Implementation
*   **Visuals**: React Three Fiber for 3D elements. GSAP for scroll animations.
*   **Structure**: Single Page Application (SPA) with lazy loading for performance.

## 5. Innovation Factor
*   **"Personality"**: Gives each agent a distinct visual identity and "soul".
*   **"Scale"**: The endless scroll emphasizes the breadth of the AEON system.
*   **"Immersion"**: Users feel like they are touring a high-tech facility.
