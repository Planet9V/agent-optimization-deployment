The Asset Management domain is relevant to securing embedded devices, requiring comprehensive asset inventory and management practices. Strengthening Identity and Access Management with multi-factor authentication and the principle of least privilege, as recommended below, aligns with the corresponding AESCSF domain. Proactive Threat and Vulnerability Management, including regular patching and vulnerability assessments, is crucial for reducing the likelihood of exploitation. Finally, a well-defined and tested Incident Response plan, tailored to OT environments, is essential for effective management of cyber incidents.  

Implementing the ACSC Essential Eight mitigation strategies will provide a foundational level of cybersecurity across both IT and OT environments. Endeavor Energy should aim for an appropriate maturity level based on its risk profile and the sensitivity of its systems. Key recommendations aligned with the Essential Eight include:  

- **Application Control:** Implement application whitelisting to ensure only approved applications can execute on critical systems, helping to prevent the execution of malicious software, including ransomware .  
    
- **Patch Applications:** Establish a rigorous process for patching applications, especially those with known vulnerabilities, in a timely manner .  
    
- **Configure Microsoft Office Macro Settings:** Disable or restrict the use of macros in Microsoft Office documents, a common vector for malware delivery .  
    
- **User Application Hardening:** Harden web browsers and other user applications to reduce their attack surface .  
    
- **Restrict Administrative Privileges:** Limit the number of users with administrative privileges and ensure these privileges are only used when necessary .  
    
- **Patch Operating Systems:** Implement a robust process for patching operating systems across both IT and OT environments, addressing known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers . Given the criticality of OT systems, patching should be carefully planned and tested in non-production environments before deployment .  
    
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for all users, especially those with access to critical systems, including OT environments and embedded devices. Phishing-resistant MFA should be prioritized where possible .  
    
- **Regular Backups:** Establish a comprehensive backup strategy for critical data and systems in both IT and OT environments, ensuring regular backups are taken and tested for restorability . Backups should be stored offline and in a separate location to protect against ransomware attacks.  
    

In addition to these Essential Eight strategies, the following specific technical and procedural recommendations are provided:

- **Network Segmentation:** Implement robust network segmentation to isolate IT and OT networks, as well as segmenting the OT network into logical zones based on criticality and function . This will limit the potential for lateral movement by attackers if one segment is compromised.  
    
- **Enhanced Vulnerability Management:** Implement a comprehensive vulnerability management program that includes regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing of both IT and OT environments . This program should prioritize the remediation of identified vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact.  
    
- **Secure Remote Access:** Implement secure remote access solutions with strong authentication and encryption protocols for any remote connections to OT systems . Access should be granted on a need-to-know basis and closely monitored.  
    
- **Embedded Device Security:** Enhance the security of embedded devices by implementing measures such as firmware integrity checks, secure boot processes, and secure communication protocols. Consider network segmentation to isolate these devices where possible.
- **Incident Response Plan for OT:** Develop and regularly test a comprehensive incident response plan specifically tailored to address cyber incidents in the OT environment . This plan should include clear roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and procedures for containment, eradication, and recovery. Collaboration with external cybersecurity experts and participation in industry exercises can enhance preparedness.  
    
- **Supply Chain Risk Management:** Implement a robust supply chain risk management program to assess and mitigate cybersecurity risks associated with third-party vendors and the software and hardware they provide . This should include due diligence during vendor selection and ongoing monitoring of vendor security practices.  
    
- **Security Awareness Training:** Conduct regular cybersecurity awareness training for all employees and contractors, emphasizing threats relevant to the energy sector, such as phishing attacks targeting OT personnel . Training should also cover safe browsing habits, password security, and the importance of reporting suspicious activity.  
    
- **Enhanced Logging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring capabilities for both IT and OT systems to detect and respond to suspicious activity in a timely manner . Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems can be used to aggregate and analyze logs from various sources.
