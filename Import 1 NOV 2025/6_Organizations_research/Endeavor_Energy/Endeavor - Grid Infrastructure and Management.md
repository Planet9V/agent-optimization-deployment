Based on my research, here are some specific models of technology used by or connected to Endeavor Energy in Australia:

**1. Grid Infrastructure and Management:**

- **Smart Meters:** While specific models aren't consistently mentioned, Endeavour Energy is deploying smart meters as part of their Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) 1. These meters record energy use in at least 30-minute intervals and transmit the data remotely 3. All new and replacement meters are smart meters 2.
- **Substations:** The "Digital Substation Transformation – South Erskine Park Zone Substation" project utilized modular buildings 4.
- **Transformer Monitoring:** Endeavour Energy uses **Edge Zero EdgeSensor** devices for low-voltage grid monitoring. The deployment includes over 7,000 new EdgeSensor devices, bringing the total to approximately 10,000. The **EE-406 Series** is mentioned as a model for the EdgeSensor (200 Series) 5.

**2. Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and Virtual Power Plants (VPPs):**

- **AI Platform:** Endeavour Energy utilizes an AI-powered cloud analytics platform developed by **Gridsight** for their Flexible Exports service [8, 8, S_S51, S_S55, S_S101, S_S103, 8, 8, S_R101, 8, 8, S_R256, 9, 10].
- **DER Management Platform:** Endeavor Energy integrates technology from **SwitchDin** for managing distributed consumer energy resources [8, 8, S_S51, S_S55, S_S101, S_S103, 8, 8, S_R101, 8, 8, S_R256, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
- **Energy Router:** Endeavor Energy partners with PowerSecure to roll out **GridBlock Energy Router** for EV fleet charging and microgrids [16, 6, 7, 17, S_R228, 16, S_R259, S_R314, 6]. The core GridBlock unit is rated at 500 kW 6. The **eHUB Energy Router** and **ePORT kiosks** are also part of the GridBlock platform 6.

**3. Network Management and Analytics:**

- **Digital Twin Platform:** Endeavour Energy has deployed **Neara**, a cloud-based engineering analytics platform, to create a 3D digital twin of their network for improved decision-making, emergency response, and resilience against extreme weather events, 19].
