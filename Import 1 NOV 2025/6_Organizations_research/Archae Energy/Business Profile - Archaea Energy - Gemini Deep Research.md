# Archaea Energy: A bp Company Revolutionizing Renewable Natural Gas

Archaea Energy, a subsidiary of bp, stands as the largest renewable natural gas (RNG) producer in the United States 1. With an industry-leading platform and expertise in developing, constructing, and operating RNG facilities, Archaea is capturing waste emissions and converting them into low-carbon fuel, making significant strides in the renewable energy sector. Archaea plays a key role in bp's plan to increase biogas supply volumes by six times by 2030 3.

## Business Profile

Archaea Energy operates within the burgeoning renewable energy sector, specifically focusing on RNG production. The company's core business involves capturing methane emissions from waste sources, such as landfills and anaerobic digesters, and converting them into usable RNG. This process not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also provides a sustainable energy source that can be used in various applications, including transportation, power generation, and heating.

Archaea's innovative approach centers around its Archaea Modular Design (AMD) for RNG plants 4. This design allows for faster construction and deployment of RNG facilities compared to traditional, custom-built plants. The AMD utilizes standardized, interchangeable components, streamlining the building process and enabling quicker scaling of operations. This standardized modular design leads to faster build times than previous industry standards 4.

Since its acquisition by bp in December 2022, Archaea has significantly expanded its reach and capabilities 5. The acquisition has provided Archaea with access to bp's extensive resources, including trading capabilities, customer base, and capital, further accelerating its growth trajectory.

## Sector and Activities

Archaea Energy operates within the oil and gas sector, playing a crucial role in the transition towards cleaner energy sources. The company's activities primarily revolve around:

- **RNG Production:** Archaea develops, constructs, and operates RNG facilities that capture methane from waste sources such as landfills and anaerobic digesters.
- **Landfill Gas-to-Energy:** Archaea also operates facilities that convert landfill gas into electricity, contributing to renewable energy generation.
- **Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS):** Archaea is in the early stages of developing CCS capabilities to further enhance its environmental sustainability efforts 6. Archaea's facilities collect landfill carbon dioxide (CO2) as part of its renewable natural gas production. Its plants take the landfill gas—primarily methane (CH4) and CO2 that is otherwise managed by a landfill flare—and process it to be sold as renewable natural gas. This CO2 is separated from the methane and has the potential to be permanently stored below ground. Adding CCS capabilities to Archaea's plants offers a safe, isolated, and effective means to reduce CO2 emissions and make RNG economically competitive for the long term 6.

## Services

Archaea Energy offers a range of services related to RNG production and utilization:

- **Development and Construction of RNG Facilities:** Archaea provides expertise in the development and construction of RNG plants, leveraging its AMD technology for efficient and scalable project execution.
- **Operation and Maintenance of RNG Facilities:** Archaea offers comprehensive operation and maintenance services for its RNG facilities, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.
- **RNG Supply:** Archaea supplies RNG to various customers, including utilities, corporations, and transportation companies, helping them achieve their decarbonization goals. Archaea has long-term contracts with universities, corporations, and utilities 7.
- **Partnership with Landfill and Farm Owners:** Archaea collaborates with landfill and farm owners to capture methane emissions from their waste, providing them with a sustainable solution for waste management and renewable energy generation 6.

## Recent News and Developments

Archaea Energy has been actively expanding its operations and making significant strides in the RNG industry. Some of the recent news and developments include:

- **First-of-its-kind RNG Plant:** In October 2023, Archaea brought online its first AMD RNG plant in Medora, Indiana 4. This marked a major milestone for the company and the industry, demonstrating the efficiency and scalability of its modular design.
- **Largest Modular RNG Plant:** In April 2024, Archaea launched its largest AMD RNG plant to date in Shawnee, Kansas. This plant significantly expands Archaea's production capacity and further solidifies its position as a leader in the RNG market.
- **Landmark Partnership with Republic Services:** Archaea formed a joint venture with Republic Services, called Lightning Renewables, to develop 39 RNG projects across the United States 8. This partnership is expected to generate a substantial amount of RNG annually, contributing significantly to renewable energy production.
- **Expansion of RNG Portfolio:** Archaea continues to expand its RNG project portfolio through partnerships and acquisitions. The company has brought six plants online in 2024 alone, demonstrating its commitment to growth and innovation in the RNG sector 2.
- **Joint Venture with Clean Energy Fuels:** In addition to Archaea, bp has separately formed a joint venture, CE bp Renew Co, LLC, with Clean Energy Fuels that has invested nearly $500 million in various anaerobic digester facilities for methane capture at dairy farms in Idaho, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa 6.
