What Is MITRE ATT&CK Framework?

The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a reliable knowledge base of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) malicious actors use to conduct a cyberattack. Organisations globally can access and implement this framework as a tool to thoroughly understand each stage of the attack lifecycle, improve their threat detection and response (TDR) capabilities, and strengthen their cybersecurity posture.

The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a reliable knowledge base of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) malicious actors use to conduct a cyberattack. Organisations globally can access and implement this framework as a tool to thoroughly understand each stage of the attack lifecycle, improve their threat detection and response (TDR) capabilities, and strengthen their cybersecurity posture.

The non-profit organisation, MITRE, has created the framework - Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK). Government bodies, private companies, and cybersecurity vendors can use the MITRE techniques to develop threat models, assess security strategies, and protect systems and data.

Implement the MITRE ATT&CK framework in your organisation with Microminder CS to strengthen your cybersecurity attack surface and stay ahead of threats.

Equip your threat hunters with valuable intelligence, such as the TTPs, to be able to hunt cyber threats effectively. Our threat hunting includes MITRE threat modelling, advanced data analysis, ML techniques, log analysis, and network monitoring to identify vulnerabilities, malware, signs of intruders, compromised accounts, access violations, etc. in your systems.

This helps your threat hunters understand if the team has the capabilities to fend off a particular type of threat. If not, they can report this to decision-makers to acquire the required security solutions to prevent the attacks.

Microminder’s security experts use the MITRE framework to perform a gap analysis of your current security strategies, tools, and techniques and the risks you face. This will give you a clear idea of your security posture.

We also do SOC maturity assessments using MITRE ATT&CK data on the latest TTPs of attackers. This checks how capable your [security operations centre](https://www.micromindercs.com/securityoperationscentreasservice) (SOC) is at handling cyber threats. We also help you fix the issues detected during these assessments and provide recommendations to further secure your organisation.

We at Microminders use MITRE ATT&CK framework data to conduct [red teaming](https://www.micromindercs.com/redteaming) exercises. These exercises simulate real-world attacks to test how effective your current security measures, policies, and solutions are and improve them. We also find and fix vulnerabilities in your systems before attackers do.

Our red teaming exercises involve people from different departments to create a culture of security organisation-wide. It encourages everyone to stay vigilant and use security best practices to avoid becoming the next victim.

We use information from MITRE ATT&CK, such as methods to detect and mitigate various types of cyber attacks, for incident detection and response planning. Our goal is to make sure you have the right defences ready to deal with a threat.

To achieve this goal, we study your IT infrastructure thoroughly and prepare a customised incident response plan to neutralise threats. We explain each step – threat detection, analysis, containment, remediation, and prevention in detail, so you don’t face difficulties at any stage.

We’re like digital Sherlock Holmes for you, detecting and investigating threats like no one else does! We use the MITRE cyber security framework’s insights that outline how to detect and investigate a specific type of cyber threat. This helps us create incident detection rules for various security solutions, such as SIEM, firewalls, and IDS systems.

We also identify all your IT assets and assess their security using penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, cloud security assessments, compromise assessments, and more. We then investigate the discovered vulnerabilities and threats in detail and notify us instantly.

We understand the procedures and capabilities of various cyber threats with the MITRE ATT&CK framework to remediate incidents faster. The framework also sheds light on the actions of the attacker throughout the attack lifecycle that we consider to remove the threat. We also help you restore your systems and operations to minimise the damage.

We also enable our security tools, such as XDR, EDR, IPS, and SIEM to ingest the MITRE framework data. This helps triage alerts and trigger automated threat responses. Save your security team’s time and make your SOC more efficient with MCS.

Enrich your threat database with valuable intel from the MITRE ATT&CK framework to stay on top of advanced security threats, such as APTs, fileless malware, ransomware, etc. This cyber threat intelligence framework will also help you understand their common behaviour and attack patterns to protect your systems and data.

The MITRE security framework standardises terminologies to simplify reporting. All our reports follow the same standards, outlining each security incident we discover, assets it compromised, its impacts on the organisation, detection and mitigation efforts, and data protection measures. This comprehensive reporting will help you during audits and stay compliant with regulatory bodies.

Our security experts continuously monitor your networks and systems to detect threats and vulnerabilities. If they detect any threats, you will receive instant alerts and trigger automated responses. They also provide ongoing support and updates to keep your defences sharp.

As a leading cybersecurity company in the UK, we help you train your teams and spread cybersecurity awareness. We do this with [tabletop exercises](https://www.micromindercs.com/cybersecuritytabletopexercise) that simulate real-world cyberattacks and how prepared your team is to face them. We also train your security teams to use security solutions effectively and help them in need.

"We had the pleasure of working with Microminder Cybersecurity for infrastructure pen testing and firewall configuration review, and I have to say, their work was nothing short of splendid. Firstly their onboarding process was so quick, the pre-requisites and availability of testing was agreed on the same day. Their team of experts went above and beyond to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in our systems, and their thoroughness and attention to detail gave us peace of mind that our application was secure.

During the pen testing phase, Microminder Cybersecurity's team conducted a comprehensive review of our systems, servers including our network devices, and applications. They identified vulnerabilities that we were not even aware of and provided us with detailed reports outlining the business impact, risks and recommendations for remediation in addition to the daily summary report. Their report is honestly out of this world! Probably the best in the industry!

Throughout the entire process, Microminder Cybersecurity's CREST certified team demonstrated excellent communication and collaborative skills, working closely with our team to ensure that our specific security and compliance needs were met. Their professionalism and expertise were evident every step of the way, and we couldn't be happier with the results. We emphasize here the well organized and working communication between our and their team that Microminder Cybersecurity provided, which made the whole process transparent.

If you're looking for a cybersecurity consultancy that is thorough, professional, and expertly skilled, look no further than Microminder Cybersecurity. They deliver exceptional results, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking to enhance their security posture."

"We engaged with MCS on a ransomware table top exercise; other companies offered 1 of 2 things. Either an in person exercise held on paper or a software you download and create the exercise yourself. Microminder was the only company we talked to that combined both approaches. We were impressed at the ability to hold a live exercise with software integrated in. We thought the project was incredible, every aspect of it exceeded our expectations. The scenario was a great test of our security process and we thought all the prompts and questions during the exercise led to great discussion. We found the exercise very valuable in testing that response plan, and found the questions asked along the way insightful. We found all the process and infrastructure improvements suggested to be very valuable and have incorporated many of them into our 2024 goals.

- The Enterprise Matrix: the MITRE ATT&CK matrix applies to attacks on enterprise infrastructures
- The Mobile Matrix: focuses on mobile operating systems (Android and iOS)
- The Industrial Control System (ICS) matrix: focuses on safeguarding industrial networks

TTPs in cybersecurity are tactics, techniques, and procedures that cyber criminals use to carry out an attack.

- Tactics are activities, such as accessing sensitive data without authorisation, compromising an account, etc.
- Techniques are the methods an attacker uses to accomplish their goal. For instance, an attacker’s goal is to take down a site. Their technique could be DDoS attacks or SQL injections.
- Procedures are steps an attacker takes while carrying out a cyber attack. In the same example above, the attacker may scan the target site to find vulnerabilities and exploit them to inject malicious code and then control the site.

MITRE ATT&CK and Cyber Kill Chain are both popular cybersecurity frameworks that help you understand the behaviour and tactics of attackers. But they are different in many ways.

Cyber Kill Chain assumes that in order for a cyberattack to succeed, the tactics must be carried out in sequence. If any of the tactics is blocked, it breaks the chain and prevents the attack. But this might not be the case with advanced or cloud-based attacks.

On the other hand, the MITRE ATT&CK framework doesn’t assume anything like that. Instead, it helps you identify adversarial techniques and tactics and prevent them.

Cyber Kill Chain covers only 7 tactics – Weaponisation, Reconnaissance, Installation, Exploitation, Actions on Objectives, and Command and Control. It’s less detailed compared to MITRE ATT&CK which covers 18 tactics in-depth and is updated regularly with the latest data.
