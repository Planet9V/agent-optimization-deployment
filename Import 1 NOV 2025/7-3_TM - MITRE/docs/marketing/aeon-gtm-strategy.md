**Core Narrative:**
- **Problem:** Traditional cybersecurity is reactive - detecting attacks after they occur, always one step behind adversaries
- **Insight:** Adversaries are predictable if you understand their psychology, motivations, and methodologies
- **Solution:** AEON predicts which adversaries will target you, why, and how - then validates your defenses autonomously
- **Outcome:** Prevent breaches before they occur, reduce alert fatigue, quantify cyber risk in business terms

**SUPPORTING MESSAGES:**

**Message Pillar 1: "Think Like Your Adversaries"**
- Tagline: "Predict attacks by modeling adversary psychology"
- Key Points:
  - 34 adversary archetypes based on motivation, methodology, targeting criteria
  - 87% prediction accuracy (6-12 months before attacks)
  - Integrates geopolitical analysis, economic modeling, behavioral psychology
- Evidence: Case study of predicting nation-state targeting 8 months in advance

**Message Pillar 2: "Test Like Your Adversaries"**
- Tagline: "Continuous autonomous red teaming with Agent Zero"
- Key Points:
  - 10x more testing than manual red teams at 1/5th cost
  - Learns from each engagement to improve attack sophistication
  - Non-disruptive testing of production environments
- Evidence: Customer achieved 94% detection rate improvement after 90 days

**Message Pillar 3: "Quantify Cyber Risk in Business Terms"**
- Tagline: "Translate vulnerabilities into board-ready business impact"
- Key Points:
  - $-denominated risk scoring integrated with ERM frameworks
  - Model cascading failures from cyber breaches to operational/financial impact
  - Communicate cyber risk in language board and CEO understand

1. **CISO** (primary economic buyer)
2. **Facility Operations Manager** (technical influencer for OT)
3. **CIO** (budget holder if security reports to IT)
4. **Compliance Officer** (regulatory driver)

**Discovery Questions:**
- "Describe your most significant cyber incident or near-miss in last 2 years"
- "How do you currently prioritize which threats to focus on?"
- "Do you model cyber-physical attack scenarios (IT breach cascading to OT/safety impact)?"
- "How often do you test your OT network security? What methodology?"
- "What's your biggest frustration with current threat intelligence?"

**Value Messaging:**
- "AEON predicts which nation-state adversaries will target your facility based on geopolitical tensions and infrastructure criticality"
- "Model cyber-physical attack chains - understand if IT breach could manipulate SCADA to cause safety incident"
- "Agent Zero tests OT security without disrupting operations - no downtime required"
- "Demonstrate reasonable care to regulators with continuous adversarial validation"

**Objection Handling:**
- **Objection:** "We already have threat intelligence from our SIEM vendor"
  - **Response:** "SIEM provides IOCs after attacks occur. AEON predicts which adversaries will target you 6-12 months before campaigns launch. We complement your SIEM by providing strategic context - which threats actually matter for your facility."

- **Objection:** "Our OT network is air-gapped - not worried about cyber-physical attacks"
  - **Response:** "74% of critical infrastructure organizations believe they're air-gapped, but Mandiant finds 68% have IT-OT connections (maintenance laptops, vendor remote access, wireless). Agent Zero can safely test your network isolation without touching production equipment."

**Competitive Positioning:**
- **vs Traditional Threat Intel:** "Recorded Future tells you what happened. AEON predicts what will happen to you specifically."
- **vs Manual Red Team:** "You test your OT security once per year. Agent Zero tests continuously at 1/5th the cost."

4. **Compliance Manager** (FISMA, CMMC requirements)

**Discovery Questions:**
- "Which nation-state adversaries do you assess as your primary threat?"
- "How do you prioritize threat intelligence across hundreds of agency programs?"
- "What's your process for assessing insider threat risk in classified environments?"
- "How do you demonstrate compliance with NIST 800-53 continuous monitoring requirements?"
- "What percentage of your threat intel is actionable vs noise?"

**Value Messaging:**
- "AEON profiles nation-state APTs by targeting doctrine - predict which adversaries will target specific programs (e.g., China Unit 61398 targets aerospace R&D, Russia SVR targets energy policy)"
- "Insider threat psychological profiling - model risk based on behavioral indicators beyond UEBA technical signals"
- "Agent Zero provides continuous validation for NIST 800-53 compliance - demonstrate effectiveness of security controls to auditors"
- "Integrate with MITRE ATT&CK for federal threat landscape - map your defenses to adversary TTPs"

**Objection Handling:**
- **Objection:** "We receive classified threat intelligence from NSA/FBI - why do we need commercial intel?"
  - **Response:** "Government threat intel is strategic - tells you adversary capabilities and intent broadly. AEON operationalizes that intel for your specific environment - predicting which programs will be targeted based on their strategic value to adversaries."

- **Objection:** "Our data classification prevents cloud-based security tools"
  - **Response:** "AEON offers on-premise deployment for classified environments (FedRAMP High, IL4/IL5 options in roadmap). Agent Zero can be cleared for testing in classified networks with proper security controls."

**Competitive Positioning:**
- **vs Government-Only Intel:** "NSA/FBI intel is strategic. AEON operationalizes that intelligence for your specific programs and priorities."
- **vs Traditional Pen Testing:** "Annual penetration tests satisfy compliance. Agent Zero provides continuous validation for NIST 800-53 and CMMC continuous monitoring requirements."

**Proof Points:**
- Case study: Defense contractor predicted China MSS targeting of F-35 supply chain
- ROI: $420M average prevented defense IP breach
- Government reference: [Federal agency CISO - unclassified testimonial]

**Procurement Strategy:**
- GSA Schedule 70 listing (federal contract vehicle)
- Approved for DISA JSIG (Joint Special Investigations Group) for classified testing
- DHS S&T partnership for critical infrastructure protection
