Threat KG integrates Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) data into its knowledge graph framework through a structured, dynamic approach that transforms static security assessments into actionable intelligence. Here's how it works, based on insights from the search results:

## 1. Ingestion of VAPT Data

Threat KG ingests raw VAPT outputs from tools like **Nmap, Nessus, and Nikto**, converting them into graph nodes and edges. This includes:

- **Vulnerability scan results** (e.g., CVEs, misconfigurations).
    
- **Penetration test findings** (e.g., exploited vulnerabilities, attack paths).
    
- **Asset context** (e.g., IPs, services, OS versions).
    

By mapping these elements into a labeled property graph, Threat KG creates relationships between vulnerabilities, assets, and attack patterns.

## 2. Continuous Integration with Live Data

Unlike traditional VAPT workflows where results are archived post-assessment, Threat KG:

- **Maintains VAPT data as "living" nodes** in the knowledge graph, continuously updated with new threat intelligence and log data.
    
- **Links vulnerabilities to assets** (e.g., servers, IoT devices) and **business-critical services**, enabling real-time risk analysis.
    

For example, a critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-1234) identified in a quarterly penetration test remains actively monitored in the graph, even after patching, to detect recurrence or related threats.

## 3. Contextual Prioritization via Graph Algorithms

Threat KG uses **graph algorithms** to prioritize VAPT findings based on their interconnected risk:

- **PageRank**: Assigns an _Asset Priority Score_ to rank vulnerabilities affecting highly connected assets (e.g., a database server linked to 50+ systems).
    
- **Centrality Analysis**: Flags vulnerabilities in "supernode" assets (e.g., firewalls, Active Directory servers) that attackers might target for lateral movement.
    
- **Path Analysis**: Maps multistage attack routes (e.g., "CVE-2024-5678 → Compromised IoT device → Jump host → ERP system").
    

This replaces generic CVSS scoring with **business-impact-driven prioritization**.

## 4. Proactive Threat Simulation

By integrating VAPT data with **CMDB logs, network traffic, and threat feeds**, Threat KG enables:

- **Attack path prediction**: Simulates how a vulnerability exploited in a penetration test could cascade across the network.
    
- **Impact analysis**: Identifies which business units or processes would be affected if a VAPT-identified flaw is weaponized.
    

For instance, a penetration test revealing weak credentials on an OT device is linked to connected IT systems in the graph, exposing potential OT-IT crossover risks.

## 5. Closed-Loop Remediation

Threat KG closes the gap between VAPT findings and action by:

- **Automating ticket creation** for high-priority vulnerabilities in ITSM tools.
    
- **Recommending mitigations** (e.g., patching, network segmentation) based on historical remediation data stored in the graph.
    
- **Validating fixes** by re-scanning assets and updating the graph to reflect resolved issues.
    

## 6. Continuous Compliance

VAPT results are mapped to regulatory frameworks (e.g., NIST, GDPR) within the graph, enabling:

- **Automated compliance reporting** (e.g., "85% of pen test findings addressed per PCI DSS").
    
- **Detection of policy violations** (e.g., unpatched vulnerabilities in systems handling PII).
    

## **Outcome**

By integrating VAPT data into its knowledge graph, Threat KG shifts from **reactive checklist compliance** to **proactive, relationship-driven defense**. Organizations gain:

- A unified view of vulnerabilities, assets, and attack paths.
    
- Dynamic prioritization of risks based on live infrastructure context.
    
- Faster mean time to remediation (MTTR) through automated workflows.
    

This approach aligns with industry trends toward **continuous security validation**, as highlighted by PurpleSec and Software Secured, ensuring VAPT insights drive long-term resilience rather than becoming stale reports.
