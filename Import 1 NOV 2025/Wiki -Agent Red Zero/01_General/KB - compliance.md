# Compliance and Risk Assessment
## Automated Regulatory Compliance and Risk Management

**Version:** 1.0 - October 2025
**Focus:** Regulatory compliance automation, risk assessment workflows
**Integration:** n8n for continuous compliance monitoring

## 🎯 Compliance Automation Framework

Regulatory compliance represents a significant operational burden for organizations. Automated compliance workflows using n8n can transform this challenge into a strategic advantage, ensuring continuous adherence to standards while reducing manual effort and audit preparation time.

### Core Compliance Frameworks

**Major Standards:**
- **GDPR:** European data protection regulation
- **HIPAA:** Healthcare data privacy and security
- **PCI DSS:** Payment card industry security standards
- **SOX:** Financial reporting and internal controls
- **NIST CSF:** Cybersecurity framework for critical infrastructure

**Industry-Specific:**
- **FFIEC:** Financial institution cybersecurity
- **NERC CIP:** Electric grid cybersecurity
- **FISMA:** Federal information security management

## 🛠️ Risk Assessment Automation

### Continuous Risk Monitoring

**Real-Time Assessment:**
- Asset vulnerability tracking
- Threat landscape monitoring
- Control effectiveness evaluation

**Risk Scoring Models:**
```javascript
// Automated risk calculation
const riskScore = (
  threatLikelihood * vulnerabilityImpact * assetValue
) / controlEffectiveness;

const riskLevel = riskScore > 8 ? 'CRITICAL' :
                  riskScore > 6 ? 'HIGH' :
                  riskScore > 4 ? 'MEDIUM' : 'LOW';
```
