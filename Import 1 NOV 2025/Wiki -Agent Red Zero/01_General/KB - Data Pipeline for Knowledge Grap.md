This Knowledge Pipeline Framework is designed to be a flexible, comprehensive system for managing knowledge across various domains. Let me break down the key workflows and components:

1. 🔍 Data Ingestion (INGEST_CORE)
    
    - Multi-source entry point
    - Supports various source types
    - Captures domain context
2. 🧠 Source Classification (SOURCE_CLASSIFIER)
    
    - Intelligent source type detection
    - Recommends parsing strategies
    - Extracts initial metadata
3. 🔄 Content Conversion (CONTENT_CONVERTER)
    
    - Transforms diverse content formats
    - Normalizes to standard markdown
    - Prepares for knowledge extraction
4. 📊 Knowledge Extraction (KNOWLEDGE_EXTRACTOR)
    
    - Extracts structured knowledge
    - Identifies concepts and relationships
    - Domain-specific processing
5. 📐 Schema Generation (SCHEMA_GENERATOR)
    
    - Dynamically creates knowledge schemas
    - Adapts to different domains
    - Supports schema evolution
6. 💾 Graph Storage (GRAPH_STORAGE)
    
    - Stores processed knowledge in Neo4j
    - Supports multi-domain storage
    - Maintains relationship networks
7. 🔍 Knowledge Retrieval (KNOWLEDGE_RETRIEVAL)
    
    - Advanced query capabilities
    - Cross-domain knowledge search
    - Contextual retrieval
8. 💡 Insights Generation (KNOWLEDGE_SYNTHESIZER)
    
    - Synthesizes retrieved knowledge
    - Generates actionable insights
    - Highlights patterns and connections
