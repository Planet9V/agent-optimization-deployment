SVCE sources carbon-free electricity, at a lower cost – allowing our communities to make large-scale reductions in emissions, while saving residents and businesses money at the same time. In addition, SVCE will advance programs for efficiency, demand management and fuel switching – to clean, carbon-free electricity in the place of fossil fuels used in transportation, buildings and infrastructure.

SVCE maintains a full-time staff, and is governed by a public Board of Directors comprised of an elected official from each member community. Member communities also designate a board alternate.  

By law, the agency is funded through program revenues only, not local government budgets.

Each SGRS event — one in the Spring and another in the Fall — concentrates on bringing together highly motivated people, fresh ideas and progressive organizations from the user, supplier and consulting communities in an intimate environment that is conducive to knowledge expansion.

We help our clients reduce their utility costs by identifying billing errors and overcharges on electric, and natural and industrial gas bills. Once errors have been identified, we work with our clients to correct them, obtain any possible refunds, and secure future savings.

We are paid for “performance.” If we do not find any savings or refund opportunities, we receive NO compensation. This shared savings approach allows our customers to produce bottom-line savings without any out of pocket expense. It is truly a win-win effort.

Our Approach is Simple:

URA only requires a 10 to 15 minute appointment and copies of our client's most recent bills to perform a detailed utility audit.  After the review, we determine if the client is being overcharged and, if so, what the potential refunds and monthly savings would be.  We implement only those recommendations that are approved by our client.  Utility Refund Agency does NOT: Sell any type of energy management equipment or lighting, recommend energy suppliers, or charge any fees beyond our shared savings.","Utilities","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Pittsburgh, PA","United States","utilityrefundagency.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/utility-refund-agency",,"✅ utilityrefundagency.com"

We apply our advanced proprietary and patented technologies in two areas:

Power Generation – We produce UPS-quality Prime Power (24/7) to grid-connected or island mode environments. Our near-green hybrid (polyphase/poly frequency) platforms intelligently blend renewable sources with conventional power systems to deliver on-demand power – while reducing emissions and cutting fuel use by 20%+. We apply our emission-free voltage generators in microgrids to deliver 'green' digital power that is resilient and reliable in a safe, and compact footprint.

Power Storage – Our hybrid storage systems employ advanced Battery Management Controls. These proprietary systems apply intelligent management of charge/discharge cycles – extending the life of batteries. Our Automatic Arc Protection System (AAPS) improves thermal stability and reduces the possibility of thermal runaway, lowering the risk of lithium battery fires.

Power Distribution – We intelligently optimize multiple energy input sources to enable the inclusion of green sustainable resources, such as solar and wind, with the predictability and performance found in conventional power systems. Our proprietary predictive A.I. controls enable 100% utilization of renewable sources, and our proprietary cybersecurity techniques provide advanced protections. The result: heterogeneous solutions that deliver on-demand power in a secure, reliable and resilient platform.","Electric Power Generation","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Cumming, Georgia","United States","bluefluxpower.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/blueflux-power",,"✅ bluefluxpower.com"

This actionable intelligence allows utility operators to prevent more damaging events including smoke, fire and explosive conditions that impact health and human safety, require unplanned and expensive reactive maintenance and impact grid reliability. 

The Sentir hardware sensing platform is fully ruggedized (IP68) and easily deployed in vaults or manholes. The device has multiple power options and utilizes any IP connection, currently secure cellular, for communications. All environmental and sensor data is visualized on the SensorView SaaS platform. Utilizing an advanced alarm management framework with artificial intelligence and machine learning a utility operator receives alerts and notifications to quickly respond and prevent potentially catastrophic events. 

In addition to environmental monitoring the platform is expandable to integrate additional sensors and use cases. Today the Sentir can also integrate underground fault circuit indicators to not only provide environmental monitoring but also outage notifications for electric faults on underground circuits.

Randy also started a garbage removal business in the late 1990s, but eventually sold it to a larger national company. In the early 2000s, he added another division to the company, Co-Man Portable Toilets, dedicated to renting restrooms.

Today, Randy Mastin Septic Tank Inc. is owned and operated by Randy and Shirley Mastin, along with their daughter, Mandi, and has two divisions.

Our first division, Mastin Septic and Well Service, provides complete septic services, including pumping, inspecting, repairing, and installing septic systems. It also provides well services, including servicing/repairing well pumps, and inspecting, upgrading, and abandoning water well systems.

Our second division, Co-Man Portable Toilets, provides the rental of portable restroom units for construction sites, special events, festivals, graduation parties, weddings, corporate events, and parks and recreation.","Utilities","11-50 employees","Partnership","Whitehouse, Ohio","United States","mastinsepticandwell.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/mastin-septic-and-well-service",,"✅ mastinsepticandwell.com"

Our proprietary rheostats are used to smoothly and steplessly vary the speed of pump motors to match the constantly changing demand for water flow rates in a wide variety of exacting applications.

Flomatcher now has well over 8,000 installed units controlling motors ranging in size from 4 hp to 4,000 hp from the cold temperatures of Alaska to the high humidity of Hawaii. There is a wide base of installed systems in North and South America. Flomatcher sales, repair and service is provided through a network of sales representatives across the United States and Canada. Some typical applications where liquid rheostats may be found are in water treatment facilities, waste treatment plants, high-rise potable and fire control water systems.
The technology behind the liquid rheostat is simple and low maintenance – there are no moving parts. Maintenance costs are the lowest in the industry because of the principle of operation and simple components. A skilled electronics technician is not required for operation, maintenance, or repair. The liquid rheostat can be repaired in the field by on site personnel with hand tools that are standard equipment in any plant. Many installations have been running their Flomatcher equipment for well over 25 years without any problems. These have proven to be the most reliable systems available today, particularly in areas with poor power quality and limited access to skilled technicians. The voltage spikes, frequent brownouts, power outages, and lightning strikes that wreak havoc on solid state drives are not a problem to the rugged liquid rheostat. An added advantage is that liquid rheostats do not generate the harmonic problems that are such an issue today with solid state drives.","Utilities","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Corvallis, OR","United States","flomatcher.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/flomatcher-inc-",,"✅ flomatcher.com"

The need for the District grew out of the necessity to provide life sustaining water and sewer disposal needs of an ever increasing population.  In the beginning, the District sent its wastewater to another sewer district to be treated. In the early 1980’s the federal government required consolidation of all treatment plants into large regional facilities. In 1987 the regional plant opened and the District combined with six sister entities to form the Central Valley Water Reclamation Facility.

A movement to “Kleen the Kish” was led by the Izaak Walton League in 1928. In response to the mandate of local voters, the DeKalb Sanitary District was organized July 12, 1928 as the 23rd District in Illinois to be incorporated under the Sanitary District Act of 1917. At that time, it became a distinct governmental and taxing body. The District was renamed the Kishwaukee Water Reclamation District on May 1, 2017.

The Federal Environmental Protection Agency was formed in 1972 and DeKalb Sanitary District came under its auspices as a “POTW” (a publicly owned treatment works). The District holds NPDES (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System) Permit Number #IL0023027.

The Kishwaukee Water Reclamation District is a Class I Wastewater Treatment facility responsible to the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the direction of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency for treating all wastewaters in its Facilities Planning Area which contains the City of DeKalb and Northern Illinois University.

By agreement with the City of DeKalb, on November 1, 1987, the Sanitary District took over the ownership of the entire “sanitary collection system” (sanitary sewer mains and manholes) for the City of DeKalb. The District now constructs, repairs and maintains that sanitary infrastructure.

Within the Northern Illinois University Campus, much of the infrastructure is private and is maintained by the University. Sewer mains on City streets passing through the University are part of the Kishwaukee Water Reclamation District collection system.","Utilities","11-50 employees","Government Agency","DeKalb, IL","United States","kishwrd.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/kishwaukeewaterreclamationdistrict",,"✅ kishwrd.com"

The Board was established for the purpose of owning and operating all properties, real, personal, and mixed, tangible or intangible, acquired or used or held for use in connection with the Tennessee Valley Authority as of June 30, 1942.  The Board has the legal power and capacity to perform any act not repugnant to law and shall have the express power and capacity to do any and all acts or things necessary or convenient for the carrying out of the purposes of KRS 96.550 to 96.900.  The Board consists of four appointed members, the term of one member expiring each year.  The fifth member of the Board is a representative from the City’s governing body.


The Russellville Electric Plant Board is a municipal electric power distributor that serves the electrical needs of customers in the vicinity of Russellville, KY with 103.7 miles of line with approximately 39 customers per mile. It began providing wireless Internet service to the greater Russellville area in 2006 and expanded its broadband services to video, telephone and high-speed data service in 2011. It currently serves approximately 4,300 electric customers and more than 2,600 broadband customers.


The REPB purchases its electric energy from the Tennessee Valley Authority under an all-requirements power contract.  The REPB has various contracts with video providers, a private phone wholesaler, and Internet gateways.  The Board, once appointed, is autonomous but makes an annual report to the City’s governing body.  As a municipal utility in Kentucky, the Electric Plant Board is not subject to the state’s Public Service Commission.

The project involves modernizing and industrializing the Curtiss-Wright R1820 radial aircraft engine—a reliable and versatile workhorse of mid-20th century aviation. The task is to apply 21st century engine technology and manufacturing methodology to the original radial platform, creating a robust new power plant for industrial applications. The new engine will be coupled with a 1000kW generator in a compact generator set capable of 1MW standby, 900kw prime, or 750kW continuous power.

Owing to the engine’s unique size and configuration, the resulting 1MW genset is remarkably small and lightweight—roughly one-third the size and weight of conventional offerings. It introduces unprecedented mobility and versatility in its power range. The unit is light enough to tow behind a pickup truck, airlift by helicopter or install on rooftops and platforms with minimal structural support. Other key performance and cost advantages are equally important: fuel agility, the clean emissions of natural gas, long service intervals, reduced maintenance and overhaul cost, lower fuel cost than diesel, and lower capital cost than comparable natural gas units. We anticipate introducing the product at two-thirds the price of competitive units.","Electric Power Generation","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Tempe, Arizona","United States","clearenergysystems.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/clear-energy-systems",,"✅ clearenergysystems.com"

AES has been heavily involved in the energy business since 1977 working with electric utilities and a wide range of commercial and industrial customers to help solve their energy problems.
 
We were approached by a client to examine their building energy systems and see what could be done to reduce their operating and maintenance costs while maintaining or improving the quality of their work environment.
 
After conducting extensive research and analysis of their energy systems, our solution was to retrofit their existing interior and exterior lighting systems with new LED lighting systems. This had a number of immediate benefits, including improved light quality and color; reduced connected lighting load; reduced cooling load and reduced peak demand and energy usage. Our study showed the projected energy and maintenance cost savings, along with available rebates from the local energy provider and available tax benefits from the IRS, made this solution a very economically viable one. With paybacks running less than two years and the availability of short term financing, the decision to convert to LED was a no brainer.
 
For those clients that wanted a positive cash flow from the first month, we teamed with up a local financial institution to provide short-term financing for their lighting projects. The monthly payment was usually less than the estimated monthly savings – thereby giving the client a positive cash flow from the beginning.

Below are actual performance statistics realized by 5 utility companies already using the app to replace read sheets or Windows CE readers.

1. ~500%+ gain in reading efficiency, took reading time for all routes down from 2 weeks to 3 days. This is based on the route reading time timer. The assumption is that readers feel pressured to complete routes quicker as their reading time is now available.

2. ~500% Decrease in time to get readings from field into billing software. Single cloud based export file can be loaded into billing software the second the last read is entered while the reader is still in the field.

3. ~80% decrease in misreads simply by displaying the low read, high read, and usage calculation in real time on the app for the reader to double check.

4. ~50% decrease in fuel costs due to readers finding most efficient way to complete readings on each route due to timer. Also, we suspect unnecessary personal detours were cut out which is why the unexpected fuel savings occurred.

A new generation of Deiter family members was now growing up with the business and through the next four decades Deiter Brothers won the trust of more and more Lehigh Valley homeowners and businesses. By 1970 Deiter Brothers was one of the largest heating fuel companies in the Lehigh Valley.

The early 1980's saw the third generation of Deiters enter the family business. Building on the traditional values of customer service and mutual trust, we expanded again by adding Walters Oil and Deiter Brothers Commercial Fuels Division.

Gasoline and diesel fuel sales grew stronger and in the early 1990's we joined the national Pacific Pride network of 24-hour card-controlled automated fueling sites.

In 2010 we launched our propane division by offering propane installation, delivery, and maintenance from the #1 ranked heating / cooling / energy team in the Lehigh Valley.

While our company has grown in size, we have maintained a sharp focus on the primary reason for this growth: customer service on a one-on-one basis.

In addition to pest control services, we gladly offer home inspections for termites, termite control, fire ant control and moisture control services.

We are also qualified to handle all of your moisture control needs. Excess moisture is a problem for many reasons. On one hand, it invites mold and mildew which in turn can result in health problems for your family. On the other hand, moist environments make a perfect breeding ground for pests. Our pest control professionals can not only get rid of your infestation, but eliminate the moisture that caused it in the first place, ensuring that the pests stay away for good.

Taking preventative measures will help you minimize the amount of pests in your home. Moisture prevention is important to eliminate favorable conditions for pests. Checking the perimeter of your home and closely assessing the exterior of your home can expose different ways pests can enter your home. Small openings into your home can make it easy for pests to infest your home.

Trustworthy, professional pest control!

Our employees are all subject to criminal background checks and are certified by the state of North Carolina to provide pest control services. You can be confident that you will receive high quality pest control services.

Heber Light & Power is a community owned Utah Energy Services Inter local providing service to more than 11,000 customers in the beautiful Heber Valley. Formed in 1909 by the communities of Heber City, Midway City, and Charleston Town, the company continues to operate the transmission and distribution system spanning 100 square miles in Wasatch County. The utility's service area spans east to the top of Timber Lakes, west to Swiss Mountain Estates and Oak Haven in Midway City, south to Daniel's Canyon, and north to Coyote Lane.

Our Power Portfolio

Heber Light & Power owns and operates three hydroelectric generators and three natural gas power plants with an overall generating capacity of 18 megawatts. In addition to the company owned generation, a power purchase agreement with the Central Utah Water Conservancy District provides HL&P's system with the Jordanelle Dam's hydroelectric capacity of up to 12 megawatts. Over 40 percent of the company's resources are renewable in 2017, beating even the most stringent energy standards across the country.

Looking to the Future

As the Heber Valley population continues to trend upward, the need for increased transmission capacity and new energy resources along with the necessity of replacing and repairing aging infrastructure challenges the company as it strives to provide reliable and affordable service. Transmission, distribution, and generation projects continue to move forward to meet these challenges. The company's commitment to the environment is supported by our net metering customers who continue to invest in distributed solar energy across Heber Light & Power's system. The company looks forward to introducing the Clear Peaks Renewable Energy Program in 2018 to further support our environmentally conscious customers. There is much to look forward to as the company grows with the community it serves.","Utilities","11-50 employees","Non Profit","Heber City, Utah","United States","heberpower.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/heber-light-&-power",,"✅ heberpower.com"

Honor God with all that we do.
Healthy things grow.
We’re not a sanitation company. We’re a people company that offers a sanitation service.

In 2014, we ordered our first shipment of 96-gallon pink carts. Five dollars from each pink cart go to the American Breast Cancer Society.
Next, we decided we wanted to give our customers another option that could make a difference. In December of 2014, we ordered our first shipment of 96-gallon black carts with a red lid. This is our mission cart and five dollars from each of these carts go toward a local non-profit.

We’ve been dependable and reliable for the past 21 years, and we plan to do that for many more. We have exceptional residential service and we are starting to grow and take on more commercial clients as well. We thank each and every person who’s helped make all of this happen. If it weren’t for our hardworking employees and our fantastic customer base none of this would be possible, so thank you.

Extensive, ongoing research and development led Schreiber to its Counter Current Aeration technology and the first activated sludge plant in the 1960s. The company introduced its Model GR aeration technology in 1979 in its first US installation.
   In 1980, Schreiber developed the single reactor-basin approach for advanced biological wastewater treatment —a technology that would lead to the development of Schreiber Flex Controls and the Continuously Sequencing Reactor. In 1995, Schreiber introduced the Fuzzy Filter, a compressible media filter system. Schreiber’s FlexControls monitoring and control systems, patented in 2008, give facilities state-of-the-art tools to maximize efficiency.
   Today Schreiber offers individual wastewater components, complete systems, and a wide range of energy-efficient and innovative wastewater treatment solutions, from influent to final discharge. With the highest quality fit and finish, Schreiber’s durable systems help achieve low operating costs while consistently meeting or exceeding our customers’ expectations. Schreiber now also provides solutions-based approaches to the food processing, pulp and paper, power, mining, oil and gas, and chemicals markets.

We currently operate over 180 water and wastewater utility systems across Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire, which combined, serve well over 100,000 people. SWSS was founded in 1995 by Deborah Trumbull and her husband Bruce Trumbull when the DEP began to pressure non-municipal, privately owned water systems to hire licensed water operators to operate and maintain their facilities, or to become licensed themselves.  One of the owners, Deborah Trumbull, was working full-time for the Littleton Water Department back then and was approached at that time to operate a small water system in the neighboring town. She saw an opportunity, said ""yes"" and started the company on a part-time basis. Over the next few years, the list of contracted water - and wastewater - systems grew and the company began to take shape and prosper, becoming Small Water Systems Services, LLC., or SWSS.  From a simple after-work, part-time, ""side-job"", SWSS has grown into a stable, successful company with over 25 employees, a 10,000 sq. ft. office building and a growing fleet of trucks. With a fully-staffed, experienced Administrative team, along with complete Water, Wastewater and Maintenance Divisions comprised of very competent, highly skilled and qualified teams of licensed operators and tradesmen, SWSS offers complete and comprehensive service to both the water and wastewater industries.  With dedication and commitment, as well as our cooperation and respect for each other, for the water and wastewater industries we serve, for the local and state regulatory agencies we answer to, and ultimately for the important services we provide to our clients, SWSS has become a strong company with a great reputation.

Our standard walled pipe is rated for 232 PSI while our heavy-wall pipe is rated for 1015 PSI. Best of all, no special tools or training are required for assembly or installation. We offer 5 different types of pipe in 13 different sizes for compressed air, nitrogen, vacuum, high pressure and oils & fluids.

The Unipipe design produces a fitting with exceptionally secure joints that is superior to every other aluminum pipe system on the market. The brilliant engineered design of the fittings, and the double-bite ring, offers a system in which the pipe will fail before the fitting fails. This means safety for your team and piece of mind for you. Check out how our product performs compared to our competitors in this pipe burst demonstration video.

Not only does Unipipe install over 3 times faster than iron or copper pipe, the smooth laminar flow of the interior of the pipe ensures steady and consistent air flow in your system. Since aluminum doesn’t rust, moisture in the lines of your system will not cause the pipe to rust and clog.

CSM has been a leader in providing private water sub-metering systems and water management services for California’s homeowners for 30 years!
 
At CSM we have always felt strongly about water conservation and individual accountability, and our solution was simple: water sub-metering.  Sub-metering involves placing individual sub-meters behind the city’s master meter for your community.  Typically, multifamily communities have one master city water meter which services all residents.  Water and sewer costs are divided equally among the residents and included in the monthly homeowner’s dues.  This worked well when water and sewer rates where a fraction of the cost they are today, and when water shortages were not an issue.  
 
In today’s California environment, sub-metering is an effective solution to manage overuse of water and the rising costs associated with it.  Sub-metering allows for an equitable distribution of cost; individual homeowners are paying only for the water they use.  Most importantly, sub-metering promotes water conservation.  When residents are accountable for their own water usage, they will be more likely to conserve.  Overall property water usage will go down and help avoid potential fees for over usage.
 
California Sub-Meters provides the reading and billing services for your community. The CSM team works with the property manager and will provide each community with a billing specialist to be the point of contact for all of the homeowner’s questions and concerns.

HOW CAN ERA HELP YOUR BUSINESS?
Simply put we audit your utility bills, (electric, gas, water/sewer) on a contingency basis whereas if we do not find any errors that create savings we do not get paid!  ERA works nationally in both the regulated and deregulated markets with full knowledge of the tariffs, statutes etc.   Having been a former utility company employee we know what to look for, who to talk to in the industry language that the utility companies understand.  
In the deregulated energy markets we often see clients overpaying for their natural gas or electric.  In these cases we can offer energy procurement recommendations from most of the suppliers for that market by offering a vendor neutral position with the best option for you based upon your usage habits.  This is not something that we charge you for!

In 1971, the Cooperative passed 1,000,000 man-hours without a lost-time accident. The record represented one of the best in the nation at the time.

By January of 1975, Community Electric Cooperative had installed some 5,875 meters and 1,111 miles of line.

James M. Reynolds was hired in 1977 by the Co-op board of directors to succeed Jean Woodward as manager. Reynolds served until his retirement in April 2013. Only the third CEO in its history, Steven A. Harmon took the helm in June 2013.

In 1979, Community Electric Cooperative executed a wholesale power contract with Old Dominion Electric Cooperative, a generation-and-transmission cooperative. Initially, Old Dominion negotiated rates on behalf of Community Electric Cooperative and its other member systems.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Old Dominion procured ownership of electric-generation facilities to support Community Electric Cooperative and the 11 other cooperatives which own Old Dominion. In 1983, Old Dominion acquired an 11.6 percent interest in the North Anna Nuclear Power Station. Old Dominion also owns a 50 percent interest in the Clover Power Station, which it built, and which went on-line in 1995. In addition to North Anna and Clover, Old Dominion has developed three peaking electric generation facilities to further support Community and the other 11 member cooperatives.

Over the last 15 years, the Co-op has recorded a growth rate of roughly 1.5 percent per year in the number of meters connected. The Cooperative currently serves more than 11,000 accounts over its 1,590 miles of distribution line.","Utilities","11-50 employees","Non Profit","Windsor, Virginia","United States","comelec.coop","https://www.linkedin.com/company/comelec-coop",,"✅ comelec.coop"

Because it's impossible to see below dark water, the condition of wastewater tanks may not be obvious until there is a problem.
SediVision provides wastewater managers, utilities, contractors, and engineers with complete visibility in wastewater tanks with no need to drain down or go off-line.
Data collected over time with SediVision can lead to a predictive maintenance schedule for wastewater tanks and help facilities make informed operational, maintenance, and budgetary decisions.
SediVision leads to better knowledge, a better investment, and a longer-lasting wastewater infrastructure.","Utilities","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Sarasota, Florida","United States","sedivision.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/sedivision",,"✅ sedivision.com"

Kern Delta currently serves Kern River and State water to approximately 90,000 irrigated acres through five different water rights:  Kern Island, Buena Vista, Stine, Farmers, and Eastside Canals.  The total length of these canals is over 126 miles, and all water is transported via gravity flow.

In 2014 the State of California passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA).

To offer better solutions, AGM has developed an add-on element: an original communication management unit to be installed at the remote field stations between the PLC and the communication transceiver (RF and/or cellular or other), empowering the distributed system, making each station smarter and having the dramatic impact the PC revolution had on the ""dumb terminals"" organizational environment in the 1980s.
This original product, called R-Win, enables smart, gradual and economical SCADA/DCS network optimization and upgrading. 

Client benefits from AGM's asset optimization solutions, the R-Win way, include:
a)      Communication resilience by lateral communication (wireless MESH). Each remote pumping or monitoring station is able to carry out two-way, real-time communication with neighboring stations and the control center.  
Each site (oil/water pumping station, oil rig, piping hub, etc.) can have both cellular and RF communication, dual SIM networks and remote configuration.
b)      All stations can initiate communication; control center polling is not needed; local/regional autonomous control processes are a standard option. 
c)      Implementation of modern, high level data security.
d)      Existing system equipment and applications, at SCADA center and remote stations, stay in place.
e)      Internet access capability is an option for all stations under security limitations. Your server is the network manager; there is no need for third-party service except for your cellular communication provider.

Central Municipal Power Agency/Services (CMPAS – pronounced “compass”) serves as a public power project-based, partial or full-requirements joint action agency. As the agent for Central Minnesota Municipal Power Agency and affiliates in Minnesota and Iowa, CMPAS identifies strategies that minimize wholesale power costs, manage future risks, and maintain stable and competitive rates. Aligned with its mission, CMPAS provides planning, procurement, and consultative services for power supply, transmission, electricity-market scheduling, and electric utility management. 

Value of Collaboration

At CMPAS, a public power utility can belong as either a partial or full-requirements member.  In contrast to a ""one size fits all"" full-requirements agency, the project-oriented approach of CMPAS allows members to remain autonomous while working together to solve common problems; create economies of scale; leverage purchasing power; and cost-share technical expertise for portfolio development, management, and administration.

Municipal electric utility members include Blue Earth, Delano, Fairfax, Glencoe, Granite Falls, Janesville, Kasson, Kenyon, Lake Crystal, Madelia, Mountain Lake, Sleepy Eye, Springfield, Truman, and Windom. The agency also partners with public power affiliates to lower and share costs of utility projects.

Consultative Role

As a strategic and fiduciary advisor, CMPAS delivers unbiased, independent portfolio system solutions that best serve the customers of municipal utilities. Each utility's portfolio is individually optimized taking into account locally-owned resources, legacy assets, and load factors. Project by project, CMPAS works in the best interest of each member as an extension of their staff.

A little about Us...

“If only this was done like we did when I was in…..”
This is a quote that is often said to spouses, friends, and coworkers by Veterans who are working for civilian companies.  For decades now, we Veterans have come back from deployment, hostile engagements, and time overseas wanting to find meaningful work that we can throw our passion behind. More importantly to find a work environment where we can trust the person on our right and left to do their jobs with the same level of commitment we experienced when we were in uniform.

The founding members of this company know and have felt that pain
Whether it be with Fortune 500 companies to family owned businesses we have seen much and decided to form a different type of company.  A company that takes all of the good things that the military services have to offer:  Plan Top Down, Refine Bottom Up; place decision making in the lowest level leadership so they can affect change; instill a sense of brotherhood where we are all working for the common goal; Mission First, People Always; Hold Each Other Accountable; Honest Feedback; and most importantly creating a place where professionals solve problems.","Utilities","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Loveland, Ohio","United States","paladinprecisionsolutions.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/paladin-precision-solutions",,"✅ paladinprecisionsolutions.com"

When you are uncertain if you require a sewage-disposal tank service, call Martins Pumping Service LLC today. We are a trustworthy and also sincere septic business with 50 years of experience.

The Value of Septic Tank Pumping
The key purpose of a septic system is to treat human waste. The septic tank divides the solid parts from the wastewater. The solid parts stay within the storage tank.
Because your sewage-disposal tank holds and also deals with various solids, it needs to be safe and also sanitary. If your septic tank has proper upkeep, it shouldn't scent whatsoever. On the other hand, a complete septic tank can scent terrible and also trigger even more problems.
