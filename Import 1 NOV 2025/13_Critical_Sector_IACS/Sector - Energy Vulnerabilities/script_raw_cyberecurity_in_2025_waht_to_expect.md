more about vanta in a few moments as we

yet again approach a new year it's time

to evaluate where the cyber security

industry is at and perhaps where it's

heading in this video as displayed on

the screen here I'll be overviewing some

predictions for cyber security in 2025

specifically the job market

opportunities potential predictions and

just General Industry Trends 2024 no

## Prediction #1) Cybersecurity Jobs

doubt was a difficult year for Security

Professionals and prospective

individuals looking to get into cyber

security we witnessed a lot of layoffs

and a general contraction of job

opportunities now mostly this was

reported in the tech sector but along

all Industries there was a general

contraction many of us had to deal with

uh lots of ghost job postings personal

layoffs or budgetary restrictions on

hiring this led to effects of being a

bit demoralizing for a lot of us cter to

what many of us see on news articles and

magazines especially this time of year

with the 32 million job shortage by you

know x amount of years I've anecdotally

witnessed something different companies

are willing to prioritize security up to

a certain extent prioritizing security

is ultimately very costly and for the

first time actually in six years we've

seen a hiring on or a halt on security

openings and positions how will this

affect the security job market

opportunities well for 2025 I personally

this is not reported but I personally

predict a potential softening in the

difficulties of Landing a job uh for

those who are very qualified and

continue to leverage the tools at their

disposal although I do foresee extended

challenges in a very competitive crowded

market for the most of us and especially

entry-level jobs it's still very much

still going to be a challenge now from a

few data or statistical perspective

industry research has shown that there's

still going to be this 3 and half

million job shortage opening of security

positions by 2025 with an expect median

salary of

$112,000 based off the US Bureau labor

of statistics and you know we've seen

numbers like these reported year after

year for several years now and it's good

to see that we've continued to see an

increase in these uh openings in median

salary but this is a lot of it just have

to do on paper um you know what the

industry is actually like versus what

it's being reported on paper may be

different and depending on who you ask I

still think that cyber security in 2025

is going to be difficult but perhaps a

little less difficult than 2024 2023 and

## Prediction #2) AI Boom / Bust

2024 were years of the Endless promises

rallies and hype of ai ai is going to do

everything and AI insecurity was no

doubt especially at the Forefront of

many Security leaders these past couple

years AI is still very much so predicted

to serve as a foundational technology to

better bolster Security even before you

know 2023 AI has been in the security

Marketplace for a while and you know

although we've seen these Grand Promises

by startups and every company reporting

with AI this um I think that there's

going to be some contraction uh

especially for over promised outcomes in

2025 AI is predicted to help but it's it

predicted to help in a very narrow nuan

Niche way and this is kind of known as

narrow AI select markets tools and

Technology are are very much so truly

benefiting from myi but in many circles

the whole AI enable AI driven AI tool

very much so overused and and just

inappropriately promised I think we'll

see narrow AI um settle into the

industry specifically and especially

angle towards a security perspective

we're going to see AI continue to help

with basic security and a and automating

various workflows for example to help

pass through massive data sets in your

security operations center maybe

streamline parts of a workflow or help

automate various components or maybe

just even just automate redundant tasks

in security those are going to be very

much so use cases that I will continue

to see in 2025 circling back from a

career perspective Security

Professionals who are able to identify

and leverage the various llms and AI

tools um at their disposal I think are

going to be continuing to have a level

up and being more productive better

suitable employees securing promotions

or just even getting hired so make sure

to continue to at least browse the the

new developments in the a industry from

an attacker perspective we'll likely see

continuation of the 2024 pattern where

AI was lowering the barrier to entry for

cyber criminals or want to be cyber

criminals for example I see cyber

criminals continuing to deploy AI to

launch thousands of targeted fishing

emails uh to VAR small businesses

consumers simultaneously customizing

each one um with various different data

sets and making it look very real and

this is going to continue to maximize

the effect of you know further

increasing your initial access and then

finally I think we'll continue to

witness attacks being leveraged on the

AI llm models themselves you know Tech

techniques such as LM jacking uh

jailbreaking out of AI guardrails and

private data being exposed by users and

employees who are uploading company data

to do whatever yeah I think we'll

continue to see a u more sophistication

in the tactics and techniques being used

to break the actual models now in

## Prediction #3) Windows EoL

October of 2025 we will witness one of

the largest end of life or ell

announcements since Windows XP which is

Microsoft plans to end the security or

updates in general for Windows 10 unless

you pay for extended support now this

time is perhaps a bit different uh given

that Windows 11 requires some arbitrary

Hardware requirements specifically uh

The Trusted platform module TPM really

this means that millions of systems are

going to lack that frequent OS updates

that Microsoft issues a lot of them

being bundled with security updates in

October and I think what we're going to

see is uh a lot of these devices being

non-compliant not being able to or

eligible to upgrade and becoming

increasingly vulnerable over time much

of the hardware in use today will be

life cycled if not already and refreshed

with new hardware but we'll likely see a

huge surge in vulnerable devices later

next year

as security updates are no longer issued

in addition to just general feature

updates good news is there's actually

predictions for an increase in

alternative desktop environments so you

know think Mac OS but also there has

been a new surge in uh desktop or Linux

friendly desktop environments such as

Ubuntu desktop which is good speaking of

## Prediction #4) Ransomware + Infostealers

scanned here we someware will continue

to pose a large threat to organizations

in 2025 we continue to see this trend

year after year I think we're going to

see these multifaced double extortion

techniques continue to evolve so you

know not only just encrypting data but

also stealing that data and perhaps even

just reselling it I think that AI is

going to be bundled into augmenting or

at least helping with the discovery

process in some ways for various

different ransomware affiliate or just

general groups specifically for initial

access I see ransomware leveraging AI to

increase the uh overall Fidelity and use

of personal data in Social Engineering

attacks which will trick victims for

sure now info Steelers have become a

very large emerging threat over the past

2 years we're going to continue to see I

think a development scale and

proliferation of infos stealer malware

there's actually just a big recent info

stealer malware takedown info Stealers

being used to steal of course sensitive

information but they can also have

various other things like such as

extorting users out of money or their

data deploying ransomware we've seen uh

joining large swarms of botn Nets so

this is just another evolution of

malware in general but I think that

we're going to continue to see a rise in

uh the overall capabilities of info

Stealers there's a lot of looming

## Prediction #5) Supply Chain Security Concerns

concern over supply chain security so

you know with a solar winds attack that

happened roughly 3 and a half years ago

there's been this growing pressure from

governments and Regulatory firms to

require a software bill of materials or

spoom basically identifying what type of

software is being used what's been

discovered these last couple of years is

a lot of what's being used by commercial

products for sale is third-party or

open-source software libraries that are

being consumed and and these are

consumer grade products that are being

sold as Security Solutions to various

different companies security company

checkpoint has predicted that there will

likely be a few very large scale supply

chain attacks occurring this year we'll

see if that happens there's no data

backing that up it's just literally a

prediction from a security perspective

we'll likely see security companies

continue to grow their practices with

evaluating and auditing third and fourth

party vendor risk and for companies that

are consuming those products to be

really diligent that we're going to

continue to see attacks in a supply

chain security it's an inherent

vulnerability and something that I think

that's continue to evolve in 2025 so

## Conclusion

these are some big industry Trends I

thought were relevant to present to this

channel for 2025 in cyber security now I

skipped over a lot of big predictions

such as Quantum Computing and

cryptographic concerns zero trust

architecture security vendor software

you know agents aka the crowd strike

incident regulatory Chang and much more

um so I will make sure to leave a few

articles in the description below if you

want to explore a little bit more about

2025 predictions in cyber security I'm

hoping you found this video informative

and have a good close to 2024 and yep

youto until the next time have a good

day
