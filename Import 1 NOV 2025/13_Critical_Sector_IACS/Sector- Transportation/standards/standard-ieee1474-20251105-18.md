# IEEE 1474 - Standard for Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC)

## Standard Overview and Scope

IEEE 1474 is the definitive international standard for Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) systems used in urban rail transit applications worldwide. Developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Rail Transportation Standards Committee, this standard establishes comprehensive requirements for the performance, functional specifications, system architecture, and safety of CBTC systems.

CBTC represents a paradigm shift from conventional fixed-block signaling to continuous, bi-directional radio-based communication between trains and wayside equipment. This enables moving-block operation where trains are separated by a safe braking distance rather than fixed track sections, dramatically increasing line capacity while maintaining or improving safety.

### IEEE 1474 Standards Family

### Relationship to International Standards

IEEE 1474 is the North American and international basis for CBTC, with harmonization efforts connecting to European and global standards:

**IEC 62290 Series (International Harmonization):**
The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) developed IEC 62290 series as international CBTC standard:
- **IEC 62290-1:2014:** Urban guided transport management and command/control systems — Part 1: System principles and fundamental concepts
- **IEC 62290-2:2014:** Part 2: Functional requirements specification
- **IEC 62290-3:2014:** Part 3: System requirements specification
- IEC 62290 heavily based on IEEE 1474 principles with global input

**European Standards Integration:**
CBTC systems in Europe must also comply with CENELEC railway safety standards:
- **EN 50126:** RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, Safety) lifecycle requirements
- **EN 50128:** Software for railway control and protection systems
- **EN 50129:** Safety-related electronic systems for signaling
- IEEE 1474 and CENELEC standards complementary (IEEE focuses on functionality, CENELEC on safety integrity)

**Regional Variations:**
- **North America:** IEEE 1474 primary standard, FRA (Federal Railroad Administration) and FTA (Federal Transit Administration) reference
- **Europe:** IEC 62290 + CENELEC EN 501xx series
- **Asia-Pacific:** Mix of IEEE 1474 and IEC 62290, often with country-specific additions
- **Middle East/Latin America:** Typically IEEE 1474 or IEC 62290 depending on vendor and consultant

### Functional Requirements

**Train Separation and Movement Authority:**
IEEE 1474 defines moving-block train separation with continuous movement authority updates:

**Movement Authority (MA) Definition:**
- **End of Authority (EoA):** Position beyond which train must not proceed
- **Danger Point:** Location of hazard (another train, open points, end of platform)
- **Safety Margin:** Distance between EoA and danger point (allows for positioning inaccuracies, communication delays)
- **Overlap:** Additional distance beyond danger point for contingency (rare on metro vs. mainline ETCS)

**MA Calculation:**
Zone Controller calculates MA based on:
- Position and speed of train ahead (from its position reports)
- Braking characteristics of following train (emergency brake rate, brake build-up time)
- Track characteristics (gradients, curves, adhesion conditions)
- Safety margins (positioning uncertainty, communication latency, reaction time)
- Interlocking status (points locked, routes set)

**MA Update Frequency:**
- Continuous updates every 0.5-2 seconds as train position changes
- Train receives extended MA as it moves and train ahead moves forward
- MA shortened immediately if train ahead slows or stops unexpectedly

**Positioning and Odometry:**
Accurate train position determination critical for moving block operation:

**Odometry System Requirements:**
- **Primary Sensors:** Wheel rotation sensors (resolvers, encoders), radar/Doppler sensors
- **Complementary Sensors:** Accelerometers, GPS (surface sections only)
- **Accuracy:** ±1-2 meters over 1 km travel (with periodic correction)
- **Slip/Slide Detection:** Detect wheel slip (acceleration) or slide (braking) and compensate

**Position Reference Systems:**

**Door Control and Platform Safety:**
CBTC systems integrate door control with platform alignment verification:

**Door Enable Conditions:**
- Train stopped within acceptable position tolerance (±0.3-0.5m)
- Correct platform side selected (left vs. right doors)
- Platform clear (no obstacles, platform screen doors open if equipped)
- Service brake applied (train cannot move with doors open)

**Platform Screen Door (PSD) Integration:**
- CBTC system coordinates train door and PSD opening/closing
- Safety interlock: Train doors and PSDs must be aligned and synchronized
- Emergency isolation: Ability to isolate failed PSD door without affecting entire platform

**Emergency Management:**
CBTC systems must handle various emergency scenarios:

**Emergency Stop:**
- **Centralized Emergency Stop:** ATS broadcasts emergency stop to all trains (e.g., person on track)
- **Local Emergency Stop:** Train detects obstacle (via onboard sensors) and initiates emergency brake
- **Emergency Brake Application:** Maximum braking rate applied immediately (<1 second delay)
- **Emergency Stop Override:** Limited override capability for rescue operations (authorization required)

**Evacuation Mode:**
- **Tunnel Evacuation:** Trains move to nearest station or emergency exit at reduced speed
- **Station Evacuation:** Trains held at platforms or directed away from evacuating station
- **Manual Driving:** Capability to manually drive trains under emergency conditions (degraded ATP)
