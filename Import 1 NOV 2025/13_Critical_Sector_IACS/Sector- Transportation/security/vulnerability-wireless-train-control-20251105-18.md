# Wireless Train Control Systems: Security Vulnerability Analysis

## Executive Summary

Wireless train control systems represent a fundamental shift in railway operations, replacing traditional wayside signals and track circuits with radio-based communications for train positioning, movement authority, and speed control. While these systems offer significant operational benefits including increased capacity, precision, and efficiency, their reliance on wireless communications introduces substantial cybersecurity vulnerabilities with direct safety implications.

This analysis examines security weaknesses across multiple wireless train control technologies:
