Okay, here's a final revision of the pricing sheet, incorporating a more detailed breakdown of the activities within each phase, along with more specific assumptions and a clearer articulation of the value proposition:

**Pricing Sheet: Cybersecurity Testing Engagement for Endeavor Energy (NCC Group)**

**Goal:** To provide Endeavor Energy with a practical, threat-informed assessment of their Microgrid, VPP, and associated OT/Cloud environments, focusing on realistic attack scenarios and actionable recommendations aligned with Australian energy sector threats (BAUXITE, VOLTZITE, GRAPHITE) and standards (AESCSF, SOCI Act, Essential Eight).

**Core Principles:**

1. **Threat-Led:** Prioritize testing TTPs used by relevant threat actors (BAUXITE, VOLTZITE, GRAPHITE).
2. **Context-Aware:** Focus on Endeavor's specific architecture, including the Microgrid, VPP, Cloud Services, vendor integrations (EdgeZero, SwitchDin, Gridsight, etc.), OT components (SCADA interfaces, RTUs, ADMS), _Microgrid integration points with consumers and partner equipment/communications, remote access systems, and grid-sized batteries in substations._
3. **Practical & Actionable:** Deliver findings and recommendations that are directly relevant, prioritized by risk, and achievable within an operational context.
4. **Safety-Conscious:** Employ non-disruptive testing methodologies, especially within or interfacing with OT environments. Leverage Dev/Test environments where possible, validating configurations against production.
