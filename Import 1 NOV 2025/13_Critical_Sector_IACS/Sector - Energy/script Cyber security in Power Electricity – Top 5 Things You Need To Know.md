and hello everyone good morning uh this

is jj speaking from malmo sweden

and um

today we are going to share with you

about the network and cyber security

especially in our electricity and we

very welcome you yeah for all of you

from sweden denmark norway and finland

and we hope you have enjoyed today's

webinar

so this is today's agenda um we have a

very tight uh schedule so um we will go

through all these important five points

um first one is the high powered scc in

this is so prone to substrate and the

second one is how those attack happens

and the third one is the core defense

concept of cyber security

and then how should we do cyber security

for power electricity and then the the

fifth one is why network security is so

important we will spend around

25 minutes and explain these five top

important things and then follow by on

how

um

business content can help so let's start

## Smarter, But Not Securer

so the first the first one is why the

power assist industry is so prone to

substrates

um

we can say it's the power it electricity

system is getting smarter and smarter

but it's not secure during the last

decade smart grid and iot digitalization

have transformed the power electricity

system smarter and smarter however on

the other hand it becomes less and less

secure

the power electricity system by nature

is not secure

it consists large number of devices and

over a large geophysical areas they are

new or old devices

and most of them they are not designed

with sufficient cyber

security to again substitute

and also the echo system is very complex

from the grid owner system integrator

service maintenance provider or product

provider

even in now we have a disputed energy

provider and also to the end customers

all these

different parties play their roles in

different stages from design commission

operate maintain and so on

so to have a synchronized or manageable

cyber security among all these part

stakeholders and also among these

different stages is a great great

challenge

and uh sun power it actually sees system

as a heart of critical infrastructure it

faces the

highest level of cyber attack

this is why the most famous attacks such

as daxnet have x blacks and black energy

crash override and so on most of them

they took power electric system as their

target

so how this

## Cyber Kill Chain

attack happened

here we would like to use the cyber cure

trend

to explain all the steps how the attack

had into your system achieve their goal

so as shown in this diagram um the the

complete network consider for example

from the external network is the

internet

and then the enterprise network managing

the for example the business activity

financials and so on and then down to

the industrial side power electricity

system which consists of three parts um

we say operate station or fill a process

so at the beginning at the beginning the

hacker starts with scattering

information to find out the weak point

of the targeted system

this stage is called reconnaissance okay

and in addition to those technology the

taker can use please think about who are

they and what are their motivations and

what they can do on you

and as we just mentioned power

electricity face the highest level of

threat attackers so they most of them

they are supported by nation states that

are countries for example by us

government by russian but or even by

foreign like china

so this kite behaker has

advanced technology and also has

extended resources so they can launch a

very serious attack on you also we have

cyber criminal they have financial

purpose and so on but please do not

forget insiders

insiders are the people very often we

think about their employees but they are

not just employees they can be there for

your former employee and also the for

example the engineer from the system

integrator the engineer from the service

provider so they can attack your system

by on purpose or even by mistake so

please think about this

and after the a hacker collects

enough information he started to do his

weapon in this stage we called

weaponization very often it's kind of

moral virus trojan or even some certain

kind of ransomware

after the weapon is ready the hacker

don't start to deliver the weapon to you

so there are several things the most

common happen to the power electricity

system the first one is phishing email

the hackers send the email to someone in

your organization it's not necessary to

be a technician it can be someone for

example in the financial department

someone in the hr department or even on

in the reception

and the people who receive this email if

if that one click

the link or open

the document in the email then the

computer is infected

the computer is directed so the hacker

has success uh his action to

get into your organization the second uh

most common way to do that is we call it

watering hole attack watering hole this

is a method that haker attacked your

supplier's website

and for instance for example it changed

manipulate the firmware

um so you to download so you download a

firmware actually that is

manipulated so it has a virus on it and

you download that firmware and upgrade

to your device and then your device

is infected so in this case we call this

is watering

attack this is a very very common

technique and the next one is remote

access although most of us we think

about okay we are using vpn it's very

safe however still remote assets is a

a very common technique that a hacker

use they can do uh

for example vpn tunnel hijacking or it

takes into your remote ss

engineering laptop so that the virus

directly go into your industrial site

so this is how i can get into you

so and today

so far and so far your system has get uh

export

and once the

the virus of malware get into your

system

today's mobile is they are so smart and

so advanced they can uh install a back

door connected to the hackers server so

that the hacker

has a direct connection to your system

from remote or from remote

and after that since the hacker get

asset you can it can do a lot of things

we call this stage command and control

for example they do pause scanning try

to do traffic analysis to find out what

kind of power exactly see control per

code you are using or gain your data

soft password and then and penetrates

your network

please uh please do not forget the the

malware still has the remote connection

to the hacker through all the stages um

for example um

according to the study like a black

energy attack the virus stays in the

power electric system and in the ukraine

distribution network for several months

until the hacker found the correct way

and found a good timing it started to

attack to that to take the action so the

action so that for example the power

electricity blackout oh they asked for

ransom or somehow

or even more serious uh kind of security

uh safety concern okay so this is how

## Defense In Depth

the cabin happens

so how should we defend ourselves

against the sabbath threat on this slide

we will try to give you a structured

view of the core defense concept of

cyber security and it is called defense

in dips

very very often we start to think about

a technology measures okay and we should

break this technology into two layers

the first layer is the component layer

and second layer is the system there the

component there is about how

how you protect your component how is

the security features on your devices

for example the os operating system

level and application software level or

on the uh the data is stored in the

devices do you have anti-virus running

on your

workstations and do you have the page

so that you keep the system updated

against the substrate

and the system level

um the network security is the most

important one that helps you to set a

boundary and blackout field out of

malicious traffic you can also install

for example like authentication server

or create photography

infrastructure so that your transmission

your communication is encrypted you can

also install certain kind of assistant

or software to manage cyber security to

monitor or to detection

on top of lut okay cyber security cannot

succeed without people conducting their

tasks in a

in

a secure manner so from the smallest

unit the personnel

and it's about

your personnel how about their knowledge

are they aware of the sidewalks sweat

for example as we just mentioned if a

financial

a person he click on the phishing email

that's very very dangerous so the people

they need to get training so that they

have the knowledge awareness to against

have a threat and in your organization

there should be someone who holds the

role or holds a function to manage cyber

security

and

extend it please think about

your ecosystem and this is very very

important as we just mentioned

um your supplier can be the source of

attack for example the supplier website

or inside the attack so this is

something you need to take extra care

so next is the policy and procedure so

in your

organization

your management level they should say

that a policy or procedure

set up the policy and procedure to

manage your cyber security normally we

call this a cyber security management

system

which covers

risk analysis how to design your system

and learn how to do commission and

operate maintenance and so on and

especially how do you respond if a cyber

instance happened and how do you recover

from the instance

this is one so-called defense in dips

and because these are layers and layers

and layers so if one layer is bypassed

or if one layer is um being compromised

by the attackers we still and have

another layer that to protect your

system the hacker need to go through all

this like a layer until they hit your um

system

this is a very very important concept

the next is that um because this concept

## Standards and Guidelines for Power Electricity

sounds very it's a huge a complex task

but luckily we don't need to invent by

ourselves there are standards and

guidelines

that help us to implement cybersecurity

and here we highlight with list some of

the most

common or most important standards or

guidelines for power electricity

and as you can see here

these are the standard or guidelines and

they can mapping into different layers

from policy and procedure and managing

the people and also talk about the

technology the system requirements or

the requirements on the components the

first one is the most common one as iso

2701 this is a

standard for ip security it's a very

very fundamental

standards very very important and based

on that we have iso 2702

i702 which is based on the o1 and

down to detail is about the code of

practice

how to implement this

and because these two these two are for

i.t security it's different from uh

so to say ot security and especially for

power electricity so

there's another standard iso 27019

this one is specifically made for the

power in a power industry and please

note that this one

we shouldn't see this one as a

stand-alone center because this one is

based on o2 and o1

and it adds the additional requirements

additional

guidelines

so if you are reading this if read

reference to the the

19 you should also reference to the

first one and the second one

and we also see this iec 62351

standard family getting more and more

popular this is because a traditional

power communication power electricity

combination protocol

like iec 60870

or iec 6870

or iec 61850

these kind of power electricity

communication protocol they

when they were designed they there was

no cyber security concern

so they do not have like like

authentication or inquiries

and this standard this new standard is

trying to enhance the security by using

the off-the-shelf

technology to in

enhance authentication and also enhance

the

encryption so that the data transmits

through

between the devices you know the device

is correct the one you are talking to

and then the data among them cannot be

peeking or

spoofing

the next one is uh also getting popular

and it's very very important for uh

industrial although this one is not

specifically made for power electricity

but it can be used in power switching so

this one is a general for industrial

automation and control system and this

is probably the only one that covers all

the layers from policy procedure to

people and to system layer technology

and also component layer

and if you are a engineer or if you are

a designer for products or systems then

you might need to know these two for

example the i3poe16836

this one is for for example the

component ied device the cyber security

capabilities

and the next one is understand a

standard for a requirement on the system

level how to do cyber security on

substation automation protection and

uncontrolled systems

and however all these standards they are

not free so not uh every people can

access to this

um so we uh if you are interested in

looking into more detail

about to learn more detail about cyber

security we strongly recommend you to

reference to these two uh one is an erc

cip the critical infrastructure

protection and on cyber security and

next one is the guideline for smart grid

cyber security these two are from the us

from the u.s america and it's a free for

download and you can learn a lot of a

lot for example this one has more than

600 pages a guideline for cyber security

on a smart grid

## Why It So Important

so the last thing we would like to talk

about is why

network security is so important uh i

think thing was security probably is the

the first one and most important one

when you think about to implement cyber

security and technology into your system

this is because a network security can

do a lot you can do prevent protect and

detect for example set up a network

boundary prevent the

malicious access and it can help you to

segment your network into small small

loans so that it can be more manageable

it can control

the device or who connecting your

network so we only allow authorized

people a device connecting your network

and we restrict the data flow so only

certain type of data can go through

your network and also the network

security can help you to do encryption

so that your data can cannot be peaked

or cannot

be

collect from the hackers and so on

i think the most important thing is

please think about if you are going to

implement cyber security in your system

you can either change for example

replace or upgrade your workstation or

rtu devices and all those components

however

even you replace each individual one it

still cannot have certain

over

a complete cyber security

and

separate network security is a practical

way and very effective countermeasure

that it can enhance security overall it

can protect the whole system and even

it's possible to do that without

with a at least a change in the system

so maybe you don't need to change the

protocol you you don't need to

re-reprogram your system

and so you can still upgrade your system

with a very very high security this is

why network security is so important

## A Complete Offer for Power Electricity

and now we would like to let you know

finnish content cake help

if you have

watched our opening video probably you

have already know that finnish content

offers a wide range of product for power

electricity

from

connect components labeling components

signaling testing

and more smart devices like a protection

provide and major

and uh transformed and sold on and today

our topic is the lego and cyber security

that fit into the cyber power

electricity and also we have our latest

smart rdu modulized rtu that has

security features

so

## A Pioneer of Industrial Cybersecurity

um

many of you probably know that fitness

content is a marquee leader and has its

long-term reputation but i think not

everyone knows that uh

phoenix hunter is also a pioneer of

industrial cyber security

uh since 2001 so it's more than 20 years

our ngo firewall and the remote assets

product

has secured a lot of num a large number

of industrial control systems all over

the world and these products

meet the the high quality requirements

and are certified with i.t security made

in germany

## Securer RTU or Securer Wireless?

so in addition to secure firewall remote

assets and so on are you looking for

more secure rtu or secure wireless okay

um our new smart rpu is a marginalized

rtu based on our latest technology poc

next technology it follows iec 2443 uh

cyber security product development

process and has advanced cyber security

features in place

and we also offer a secure wireless

product family we call this radioline

and by using our proprietary protocol we

call this a trustee wireless

some compared to

the open standard like wi-fi

bluetooth and so on radio line is much

more secure and much more reliable

## A Trustworthy Supplier

and it's very important that you you

have a trustworthy supplier as i

mentioned the supplier is very very

important and fitness content holds the

secure product development certificate

that is iec

62443-401 and also we hold the

certificate of service provider

so with this tool

we can help we can deliver

cyber security high cyber security level

of product and service

and as your supplier is very very

important phoenix contact takes the

responsibility and should be very open

and responsive

to regarding to cyber security in

several instances so we have a product

security instance responsible team

and

we have uh most updated security

advisories on the website you can find

the product information is there any

vulnerability or how can you solve it

and how is our advice if you have

several instances there is a

vulnerability find on the products

you can submit if you find

a vulnerability or several instances

submit to the website or you can

subscribe to get the most updated

information to keep your system safe

so today uh we very quickly go through

um the most important part of cyber

security especially for the power

electricity

and it then this one is not only one

it's only a starting point it's the

overview and on the following months

uh

each uh uh scene in the second friday

like today the second friday we will

launch more topic get into deeper and to

to help you to understand uh what you

need and what we can help regarding to

power electricity systems for example in

october we will help you to review your

network

and see how we can do

to help to separate your network um by

our new amgar firewall even without

changing your network configuration

and in november we will dig in to the

firewall to find out the advanced

features not only the rules okay we will

we will um we will discuss how to how to

implement firewall rules in the

efficient way in the right way and also

to find out more if um

more useful uh features that can help

you to secure power electricity system

and in december we will talk about

remote access as i just mentioned um

people think that vpn remote access is

secure however it is not but how do you

do how can you enhance so we will

introduce our mgor smart a portable a

portable remote access device so that we

can help your system or skill and there

are more to follow

for example how to minimize

attack interface of your system by using

our power electricity managed switches

and how about the cloud service we have

a checklist for you to consider is if

your cloud is skilled or not

and

on in march

we will talk about patch management how

to do a secure a firmware upgrade for

largest system okay so this is the of

webinar we planned for you

and i think today we just have 30

minutes it's very very short

but

a brief summary for you

cyber electricity systems are prone to

cyber threat

and the cyber kill trend can give us a

clue about how to do the defense

okay and develop defense in deep

strategy is very very important

a successful cyber security relies on

the people process and technology

network security is one of the most

important countermeasures that can

protect the system overall

several

fitness content is a com has a complete

offer for power industry

and we are your trustworthy supplier

especially for network security center

security products solutions and services

and this is today's webinar i hope you

enjoy it

and

please stay tuned with us and please uh

stay tuned for uh for

the future naval and cyber security uh

web webinars okay so i hope you enjoyed

i don't know if there is any questions

daniel

yes we had one question here i think

latest in plc security and how

to secure old plc modules

of course it depends on which kind of

plc you are using

uh

if the supplier can give you update then

you should do update but it's a big task

so as i just mentioned please think

about cyber security in layers

if if your plc cannot be updated then

you should think about using other layer

to protect your

device for example as i mentioned using

network security

using network security to protect your

system

so either you upgrade your plc or you

replace it to a new one for example our

smart rtu

or you should implement a network

security so that uh to to help to

protect your system

but the ideal uh the ideal process is

that you have both

so

uh

always the best you have upgrade your

plc and also have the network security

protect you so that when the acres cast

in

it has to go through two layers

so i hope this answer your question

any other questions

if not uh we are going to uh finish the

webinar i hope you enjoy it

and uh please stay tuned with us
