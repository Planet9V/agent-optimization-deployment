## Introduction

[Music]

hi everyone and welcome to our channel

my name is mandana white and i'm the ceo

of smartgrid forums and today i'm

delighted to say that we have with us

francis cleveland who is the president

of zampus consulting international and

francis is here to discuss with us or to

give us a preview of the presentation

that she's going to give at the ic61 850

week 2021 event in october so welcome

france it's delighted to have you here

yeah i'm glad to be here great wonderful

## Why is IEC 62351 important

so francis you're actually going to be

speaking on the cyber security day on

friday the 22nd of october

and you're going to be addressing the

subject of iec 62351

which is a standard for securing digital

substations and their interactions with

the dr infrastructure

um so now let's start with um what what

you think or why you think

implementing 62351

is so critical right now for utilities

uh cyber security has become very very

important in the

cyber physical world of utilities

uh in the past it was something that

could be

semi-ignored but it is now absolutely

clear that uh cyber security measures

are going to have to be implemented in

order to keep this critical

infrastructure of the electric power

grid actually operating

so it is

critical to

understand what you need to do for cyber

security and then with a six two three

five one series

to understand how best to implement it

so this is really something that has

come up recently

in particular

we have the addition of distributed

energy resources that are owned and

operated by third parties and may not be

uh under the same uh cyber security

requirements

as a utility would be

and they don't have the same level of

expertise as utilities may have in cyber

security

so it is really really vital to first

understand what

needs to be done

and then using the six two three five

one series uh and other uh standards to

determine exactly how to

meet the cyber security protection

requirements

right okay and for those utilities who

## Key considerations

are keen to get going with um you know

designing their six two three five one

based cyber security system

and uh implementing it what would you

say are the you know key considerations

or the major challenges that they're

likely to face at the start of this

process that they've got to be mindful

of

that is a difficult situation for

utilities no question cyber security is

very complex

it's as complex from a cyber perspective

as operating the power system itself

and uh involves engineering practices as

much as sort of cyber cryptographic

practices

so it is not easy to understand exactly

what needs to be done and every utility

would need to go through some form of

risk assessment risk management process

that said

what we have in the six two three five

one series is the ability to perform

some of the key

cyber security requirements like for

data

it's managing uh the authentication

uh and eventually authorization aspects

of exchanging information uh amongst all

of the uh systems in in the power system

also involves monitoring the networks

themselves uh

so that

it's clear what kind of uh normal

traffic and maybe abnormal traffic is

going over the networks

so there are a number of um

methods

in the standards to actually accomplish

these tasks

right okay and for those who do um you

## Biggest payoff

know start the implementation or who are

keen to start the implementation

soon what would you say are the biggest

payoffs of getting started earlier on

this journey

well the the biggest payoff is uh first

of all to avoid having a cyber security

attacks or successful ones they're going

to be attacks but successful ones and

either mitigate the the um impacts

or uh be able to avoid them all together

starting early though means that the

costs for implementing uh these

standards uh such as implementing uh

authentication for the 61 850

um

secure

power system uh communications

um is really vital it will minimize the

cost because it's so much more difficult

to add something after the fact

so

starting right away it's important to

include the

62351 standards in the design or the

updates or the upgrades of various

systems and in particular the

distributed energy resources because

that's a new area and a very complex

area

from um a management cyber security

management perspective

right okay well that's great and at the

## How widely implemented

moment at this moment in time um how

widely implemented is 62351 do we have

uh solid examples of utilities who've

been working on this area

uh there are a number of utilities that

are working on it nl in um italy is

probably one of the first uh has been

really supportive in both developing the

standards and in implementing them

we also have other utilities like edf in

france and hydro quebec in

canada

that are

actively

utilizing the six two three five one

series

as they develop uh new systems

so it's really good to see that they're

doing that um

it still remains a challenge for many of

the other maybe smaller utilities uh to

implement these standards but as time

goes on and the vendors implement or uh

integrate

62351 into all of their products it will

become

somewhat easier to actually implement it

but

avoiding the the terrible impacts of a

cyber security attack is well worth that

effort it

absolutely well yeah i won't minimize

the

difficulty it is difficult uh

but it is absolutely critical in this

new world of cyber attacks

absolutely and we're seeing increased

numbers of incidents not just within the

grid but more widely as well so it's

become the new normal that we have to

manage

um okay that's great thank you so much

francis for that preview into your

presentation we look forward to hearing

the full presentation in october and

again your session is taking place

during the cyber security seminar on

friday the 22nd of october at iec 61 850

week 2021 which will now be held

entirely virtually on the swap card

virtual event platform so thank you so

much francis lovely to talk to you today

and we look forward to seeing you in

october have a great day

okay thank you very much and i hope to

see you all there

thank you so much for watching i hope

you found this video insightful and

enjoyable we post new smart grid related

videos every friday at 12 cet so please

go ahead and subscribe and let

colleagues in other departments and

peers in other organizations know so

that they can benefit too

we welcome your feedback so if you have

any comments or questions please feel

free to post them below thanks again and

have a great day
