most of the assets of a power system

live inside electrical substations but

if you're not familiar with the

equipment

it kind of all looks the same and it's

difficult

to make any sense of it so let's take a

look

inside the substation and will learn

about the different assets

their main duties and how they operate

first of all let's look at the

substation from a very high level

and this diagram shows a single phase

equivalent

of course a real substation will have

three phases and it will likely have

several feeders

so what you see here is replicated many

times over

inside a substation

## Voltage Transformer

now the first asset we'll look at is the

voltage transformer or current

transformer normally a substation has

both

vts and cts have the job of measuring

voltage and current in the substation it

then passes this information

either directly to a relay to make the

decision on whether

a fault condition is present or it goes

into the communication infrastructure

of the substation and then passed on to

the control room

modern vts and cts have merging units

these convert the measured voltage and

current

into a digital form that can then be

passed

into iec 61850 which is a new

communication protocol

for handling digital information inside

a substation

old-fashioned cts and vts can send

the recorded signal straight to a relay

## Disconnector

next one we'll look at is called the

disconnector

so the disconnector is a very simple

asset in construction it's made up

of a swinging arm so this is just really

a mechanical switch

now disconnectors are cheap they

are reliable but they're not able to

break

load current or fault current so that's

one of the big weaknesses of a

disconnector in fact if you try to break

load current or fault current you just

get a giant arc

so it's a very specialist job actually

to break

fault current and load current but

disconnectors do play an important role

inside the substation because they allow

other assets most importantly the

circuit breaker

to be isolated and it's reassuring if

you're working or maintaining a circuit

breaker

it's reassuring that you have that

physical separation between you

and the rest of the circuit that's a

disconnector

## Circuit Breaker

now we move on to the circuit breaker so

as i mentioned before the circuit

breaker

has the important and difficult job

of breaking load current and

fault current and this is really

difficult actually so

circuit breakers tend to be more complex

in construction

and therefore more expensive but they

play such a crucial role

in the protection system of the

substation

so most circuit breakers have some kind

of mechanism

to physically pull the two connections

apart

and then extinguish the arc so examples

of this

are air blast circuit breakers and sf6

based

circuit breakers so that's the circuit

breaker

they're very expensive but really

important inside a substation

now the most expensive and largest

asset inside the substation is the

transformer so the transformers really

are

playing a very important role inside a

substation because they step up

and step down the voltage now one of the

most striking features of the

transformer

is the giant radiator that's normally

bolted

on the side of the transformer now the

purpose of this radiator

is to help with the cooling of the

transformer because

you know transformers transfer vast

amounts of energy and they do run

hot so oil is used as the coolant

the radiator on the side is an

additional measure to help

cool down the transformer and typically

oil will flow through the radiator

and you'll have heat exchange you also

sometimes have

fans underneath the radiator to help

with the cooling

just as you would in a laptop actually

now the main chamber houses the windings

and of course this is where

the um electrical uh role of the

substate of the transformer is carried

out

the stepping up and the stepping down

and we also have

another well a noticeable feature is

an oil containment measure so

transformers contain lots of oil

and if they leak there has to be a way

to contain that oil so normally

an oil containment measure sometimes

these are called buns

they're used to to contain any leak

of oil now on the protection of the

transformer when the transformer fails

normally you get a reaction in the oil

which causes the

level of the oil to fall so a buck holds

relay

is a very cheap and effective way

to monitor this and to detect a

transformer failure so

you'll always see a buckhold relay on a

transformer it's just a way

to detect failure in a transformer in an

automated way

## Relay

we also have in a substation a building

called the relay house and as the name

suggests this is home

to the relays of course the job of the

relay

is to monitor the voltage and current

and make a decision on whether there's a

fault

if there is a fault it will send the

signal to the circuit breaker to trip

so the relay is an automated way to do

this we also have the battery

so the battery in the substation is a

way to power the equipment

if you get complete power outage

so really important the batteries is so

important in a substation

## Protection System

and we can group together the vt and ct

the disconnectors and the circuit

breaker

and call these the protection system of

the substation

and they perform a really important job

in the substation because

they actually protect the grid from

faults and automatically respond if

there is a fault

so let's group these together and call

them the protection system now there's

also one other type of

asset which is important this is called

the surge arrester and the job of the

surge arrester

is to protect the transformer and other

parts of the substation

against high frequency surges such as

lightning strikes and

switching surges the conventional

protection system isn't fast enough to

protect against

lightning strikes and switching surges

so all these

assets together are called the

protection system

## Buzz Bars

so all of these assets work together to

form

the substation so we've gone through all

of the main assets now

there is one other important element of

the substation

uh called the buzz bars now the buzz

bars are the way

that all of these assets are connected

together so

you can think of buzzbars as just a low

impedance

piece of metal which connects assets

together

within the substation obviously these

buzz bars

are very high above ground so they're at

a safe level

but they're also very important another

important aspect of the substation is

the earthing grid

so underneath the substation you have

a grid a metallic grid and that helps

maintain safe step and touch voltages

within the substation

to protect personnel from dangerous

voltages

and to also provide a low impedance path

to ground if there's a fault
