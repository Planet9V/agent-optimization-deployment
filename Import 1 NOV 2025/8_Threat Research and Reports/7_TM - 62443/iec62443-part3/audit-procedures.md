## IEC 62443-3-3 Audit Methodology

### 1. Pre-Audit Preparation
**Objective:** Ensure comprehensive audit coverage

**Activities:**
- Review system architecture and zone design
- Verify security level assignments
- Assess foundational requirements implementation
- Review security level requirements
- Interview system administrators and security personnel

**Deliverables:**
- Audit scope and objectives document
- System architecture review report
- Security requirements mapping
- Interview questionnaires and responses

### 2. Foundational Requirements Audit
**Objective:** Verify FR implementation across all security levels

**Audit Areas:**
- **FR 1 (IAC):** Authentication and authorization controls
- **FR 2 (UC):** Access control and use restrictions
- **FR 3 (SI):** System integrity protection
- **FR 4 (DC):** Data confidentiality measures
- **FR 5 (RDF):** Data flow control mechanisms
- **FR 6 (TRE):** Event detection and response
- **FR 7 (RA):** Resource availability assurance

**Evidence Collection:**
- Configuration files and settings
- System logs and audit trails
- Security policy documents
- Test results and validation reports

### 3. Security Level Requirements Audit
**Objective:** Assess SL-specific requirements implementation

**Audit Criteria:**
- **SL 2 Requirements:** Secure communications, malware protection, secure updates
- **SL 3 Requirements:** Enhanced authentication, intrusion detection, security monitoring
- **SL 4 Requirements:** Advanced threat detection, automated response, continuous assessment

**Compliance Verification:**
- Technical control implementation
- Process and procedure effectiveness
- Monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Incident response capabilities

### 4. System Integration Audit
**Objective:** Verify integrated security control effectiveness

**Review Areas:**
- Security control interactions
- System-wide security posture
- Control effectiveness measurement
- Continuous improvement processes

**Performance Evaluation:**
- Control coverage and effectiveness
- System resilience and response
- Security metrics and KPIs
- Improvement initiative results
