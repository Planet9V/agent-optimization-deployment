CUI//FOUO: CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION // FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Rhysida ransomware group has executed a systematic 46-day government sector targeting campaign (June 12 - July 28, 2025) representing the most comprehensive assault on American local and state governance infrastructure in modern cyber warfare history. This campaign has systematically compromised 8 city governments and 3 state agencies, disrupting public services for 2.1 million citizens and exposing sensitive government operations and citizen data. The operation's methodical approach to targeting democratic institutions and essential public services demonstrates a strategic shift toward governance disruption and public trust erosion through systematic infrastructure weaponization.

Critical Campaign Intelligence:

Government Scope: 8 city governments and 3 state agencies with 2.1M+ citizen service dependencies

Public Service Impact: Essential services disruption affecting emergency response, utilities, and social services

Democratic Process Threats: Electoral system probing and voter database compromise attempts

Citizen Data Exposure: 890,000+ citizen records compromised including SSNs, tax information, and legal documents

Strategic Intent: Democratic institution destabilization and public trust erosion through governance disruption

Strategic Implications: Rhysida's systematic government targeting represents an unprecedented assault on American democratic institutions and public services, requiring immediate federal coordination and potential national security response to prevent erosion of public trust and governance capability.
