DRAGONFORCE RANSOMWARE ECOSYSTEM - 200% Attack Surge and Alliance-Based Expansion

Classification: TLP:AMBER+STRICT
Date: August 7, 2025
Threat Level: CRITICAL
Campaign: DragonForce RaaS Ecosystem Expansion
Attribution: DragonForce Ransomware Group + Five Families Alliance

🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

DragonForce ransomware has achieved an unprecedented 200% attack surge in Q1 2025, fundamentally transforming from an individual threat actor to the cornerstone of a revolutionary "Ecosystem Ransomware" model. Through strategic alliance with the "Five Families" consortium, DragonForce has created a force multiplier effect that enables exponential capability growth across the entire ransomware landscape. With Malaysian origins providing jurisdiction arbitrage and Russian-aligned infrastructure ensuring operational security, DragonForce represents the maturation of ransomware from criminal enterprise to industrialized ecosystem.

Critical Ecosystem Intelligence:
