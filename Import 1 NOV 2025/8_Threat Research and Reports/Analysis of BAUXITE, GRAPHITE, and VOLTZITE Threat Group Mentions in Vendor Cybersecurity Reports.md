Cyble's threat actor profile for Sofacy (APT28) also lists "Graphite" as one of their tools . Despite this established link between Graphite malware and APT28, the provided excerpts from Cisco, Nozomi Networks, Clarity, PwC, and Fortinet do not mention the "GRAPHITE" threat group by name in their annual reports . These vendors likely refer to the activities of this threat group under the more established names of APT28 or Sofacy.  
        
- **7.3 Mentions of VOLTZITE Threat Group**
    
    - Dragos' 2025 OT/ICS Cybersecurity Report identifies VOLTZITE as an alias for the Volt Typhoon threat group, a Chinese state-sponsored actor known for targeting critical infrastructure with a focus on stealing OT-relevant data . This connection is widely recognized within the cybersecurity community. Wikipedia notes that VOLTZITE is one of the many aliases used to refer to Volt Typhoon, which is also known as VANGUARD PANDA and BRONZE SILHOUETTE . Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs also lists Volt Typhoon as a threat actor, explicitly including Voltzite and VANGUARD PANDA among its aliases, and highlights its targeting of critical infrastructure in the US, Australia, India, and the UK for espionage . MITRE ATT&CK similarly lists Volt Typhoon (G1017) with Voltzite and VANGUARD PANDA as associated groups, emphasizing their targeting of US critical infrastructure and potential for disruptive attacks on OT assets . The Maryland Department of Information Technology also identifies Volt Typhoon with Voltzite as an alias, confirming their focus on US critical infrastructure . While the specific name "VOLTZITE" is not mentioned in the provided excerpts from Cisco, Nozomi Networks, and PwC , Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs does mention "Volt Typhoon" in a Threat Signal report . This indicates that while the specific "VOLTZITE" moniker might not be universally adopted in annual reports, the underlying threat actor is widely tracked and reported on, particularly by vendors with a focus on critical infrastructure security.  
        

**8. Conclusion**

The analysis of the provided research material reveals that Dragos' 2025 OT/ICS Cybersecurity Report is the primary source for the identification of BAUXITE and GRAPHITE as new OT cyber threat groups. BAUXITE is linked to Iranian-affiliated CyberAv3ngers, while GRAPHITE is associated with the Russian APT28/Sofacy group. Based on the provided excerpts, these specific names were not found in the annual reports from Cisco, Nozomi Networks, or PwC. VOLTZITE is identified as a recognized alias for the well-known Chinese state-sponsored Volt Typhoon threat group, which targets critical infrastructure. This connection is widely reported across the cybersecurity industry, including by Dragos, Fortinet (as Volt Typhoon), MITRE ATT&CK, and government cybersecurity resources. While the specific name "VOLTZITE" was not found in the Cisco, Nozomi, or PwC excerpts, Fortinet does report on Volt Typhoon. This highlights the role of specialized vendors like Dragos in providing in-depth analysis of threat actors within specific domains like OT/ICS. It also demonstrates that different vendors may prioritize different threat actors and use varying naming conventions in their annual reports. For a comprehensive understanding of these and other threat groups, it is essential to consult a variety of threat intelligence sources, including the full annual reports from each vendor and their dedicated threat intelligence platforms.
