Based on the case study provided in the search results, the key challenges BDO faced when helping the global technology services provider create a crisis management team were:

1. Lack of formalized crisis response structure: The company did not have an established framework for responding to crises, forcing them to be reactive rather than proactive.
2. Decentralized decision-making: There was a need to formalize the decision-making processes during crises.
3. COVID-19 pandemic impact: The sudden onset of the pandemic created an urgent need for a crisis management strategy, especially since the company couldn't implement a complete work-from-home policy due to providing essential services.
4. Balancing employee safety with operational continuity: The company needed to protect its employees while continuing to provide services to essential customers in critical infrastructure sectors.
5. Multiple threats: The company realized that COVID-19 was not the only threat they faced, and needed a comprehensive approach to protect against a dynamic operating environment.
6. Global scale: With 80+ offices and 10,000+ employees across 21 countries, coordinating a unified crisis response was complex.
7. Transitioning from external to internal crisis management: After BDO helped establish the crisis management program, there was a need to transition to an internal team to capitalize on the investment.

BDO's approach to addressing these challenges involved:

1. Establishing a crisis response structure
2. Shifting the company's paradigm from reactive to proactive
3. Formalizing decision-making processes
4. Implementing intelligence gathering mechanisms
5. Creating a comprehensive crisis management program with policies, engagement strategies, training plans, and a three-year roadmap
6. Supporting the hiring and onboarding of a full-time internal crisis management team

This case study demonstrates BDO's ability to help large, complex organizations develop and implement effective crisis management strategies, even in the face of immediate and multifaceted challenges.
