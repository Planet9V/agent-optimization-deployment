## 🎯 Standard Overview

IEC 62443-4-1 defines the security development lifecycle requirements for industrial automation and control systems products. It provides a structured approach to building secure industrial systems from the ground up.

### Key Objectives
- **Secure Development:** Establish security requirements throughout the development lifecycle
- **Risk Management:** Address security risks during design and implementation
- **Compliance:** Meet industrial security standards and regulatory requirements
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensure security is built into products, not added later

### Scope and Applicability
- **Products:** Industrial control systems, SCADA systems, PLCs, HMIs
- **Development:** Software and hardware development for industrial environments
- **Lifecycle:** Complete product lifecycle from conception to end-of-life
- **Security Levels:** Applicable to all IEC 62443 security levels (1-4)
