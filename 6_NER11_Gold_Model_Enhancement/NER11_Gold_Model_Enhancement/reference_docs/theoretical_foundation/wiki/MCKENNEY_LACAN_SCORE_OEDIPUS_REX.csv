33,STAGE,"To Laius, King of Thebes, an oracle foretold that the child born to him",0.01,0.3,0.99,0.2,R,9/10
34,STAGE,by his queen Jocasta would slay his father and wed his mother. So when,0.01,0.3,0.99,0.2,R,9/10
35,STAGE,in time a son was born the infant’s feet were riveted together and he,0.01,0.3,0.99,0.2,R,9/10
36,STAGE,was left to die on Mount Cithaeron. But a shepherd found the babe and,0.01,0.3,0.99,0.2,R,9/10
37,STAGE,"tended him, and delivered him to another shepherd who took him to his",0.01,0.3,0.99,0.2,R,9/10

40,STAGE,doubting his parentage he inquired of the Delphic god and heard himself,0.01,0.3,0.99,0.2,R,9/10
41,STAGE,the word declared before to Laius. Wherefore he fled from what he,0.01,0.3,0.99,0.2,R,9/10
42,STAGE,deemed his father’s house and in his flight he encountered and,0.01,0.3,0.99,0.2,R,9/10
43,STAGE,unwillingly slew his father Laius. Arriving at Thebes he answered the,0.01,0.3,0.99,0.2,R,9/10
