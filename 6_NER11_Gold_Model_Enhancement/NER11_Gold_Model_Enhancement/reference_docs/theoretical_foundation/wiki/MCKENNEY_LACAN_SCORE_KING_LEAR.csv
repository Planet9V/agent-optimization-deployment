45,STAGE,What this is and isn't. This was taken from a copy of,0.01,0.3,0.99,0.2,R,9/10
46,STAGE,Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can come in,0.01,0.3,0.99,0.2,R,9/10
47,STAGE,ASCII to the printed text.,0.01,0.3,0.99,0.2,R,9/10

59,STAGE,Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are,0.01,0.3,0.98,0.2,R,9/10
60,STAGE,textual differences between various copies of the first folio. So,0.01,0.3,0.98,0.2,R,9/10
61,STAGE,there may be differences (other than what I have mentioned above),0.01,0.3,0.98,0.2,R,9/10
62,STAGE,between this and other first folio editions. This is due to the,0.01,0.3,0.98,0.2,R,9/10
63,STAGE,printer's habit of setting the type and running off a number of,0.01,0.3,0.98,0.2,R,9/10
64,STAGE,copies and then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type,0.01,0.3,0.98,0.2,R,9/10
65,STAGE,and then continuing the printing run. The proof run wasn't thrown,0.02,0.3,0.98,0.2,R,9/10
66,STAGE,away but incorporated into the printed copies. This is just the,0.02,0.3,0.98,0.2,R,9/10
