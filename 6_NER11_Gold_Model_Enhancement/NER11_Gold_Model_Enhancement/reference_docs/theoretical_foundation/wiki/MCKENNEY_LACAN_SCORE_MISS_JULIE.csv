1028,MAURICE,his heart is beating with dread of having lost what it holds most,0.12,0.3,0.85,0.2,R,8/10
1029,MAURICE,precious. Can you believe me if I tell you that Adolphe is under,0.12,0.3,0.85,0.2,R,8/10
1030,MAURICE,this roof? Within a minute he will be standing in the middle of,0.12,0.5,0.85,0.2,R,8/10

1037,MAURICE,we'll regret this.,0.12,0.3,0.85,0.2,R,8/10

1039,MAURICE,[Trying to speak unconcernedly] There you are! What,0.12,0.45,0.85,0.7,R,8/10

1048,HENRIETTE,worst and worrying yourself needlessly. I suppose you imagined,0.12,0.3,0.85,0.2,R,8/10
1049,HENRIETTE,that we wanted to avoid your company. And though you see that we,0.12,0.3,0.85,0.2,R,8/10

1067,ADOLPHE,depression which it hurt me to watch. But nobody was angry with,0.12,0.3,0.85,0.2,R,8/10
1068,ADOLPHE,"you, believe me. Your friends understood, and they regarded your",0.12,0.3,0.85,0.2,R,8/10
1069,ADOLPHE,failure to come with sympathetic forbearance. Madame Catherine,0.22,0.3,0.85,0.2,R,7/10
1070,ADOLPHE,herself defended you and proposed your health. We all rejoiced in,0.12,0.3,0.84,0.2,R,8/10

1192,MME,heard a while ago? Is it true that you have sold a picture in,0.14,0.5,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
1193,MME,"London for a high price, and that you have got a medal?",0.14,0.5,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
1194,ADOLPHE,"Yes, it's true.",0.14,0.3,0.83,0.7,R,8/10
1195,MME,CATHERINE. Merciful heavens!--and not a word do you say about,0.14,0.55,0.83,0.7,R,8/10
1196,MME,it?,0.14,0.5,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
1197,ADOLPHE,"I am afraid of fortune, and besides it seems almost",0.14,0.3,0.83,0.7,R,8/10
1198,ADOLPHE,worthless to me at this moment. I am afraid of it as of a spectre:,0.14,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
1199,ADOLPHE,it brings disaster to speak of having seen it.,0.14,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
1200,MME,"CATHERINE. You're a queer fellow, and that's what you have",0.14,0.3,0.83,0.7,R,8/10
1201,MME,always been.,0.14,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
1202,ADOLPHE,"Not queer at all, but I have seen so much misfortune come",0.14,0.3,0.83,0.7,R,8/10
1203,ADOLPHE,"in the wake of fortune, and I have seen how adversity brings out",0.14,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
1204,ADOLPHE,"true friends, while none but false ones appear in the hour of",0.14,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
1205,ADOLPHE,"success--You asked me if I ever went to church, and I answered",0.14,0.4,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
1206,ADOLPHE,evasively. This morning I stepped into the Church of St. Germain,0.14,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
1207,ADOLPHE,without really knowing why I did so. It seemed as if I were,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1208,ADOLPHE,looking for somebody in there--somebody to whom I could silently,0.14,0.4,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1209,ADOLPHE,offer my gratitude. But I found nobody. Then I dropped a gold coin,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1210,ADOLPHE,"in the poor-box. It was all I could get out of my church-going,",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1211,ADOLPHE,"and that was rather commonplace, I should say.",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1212,MME,CATHERINE. It was always something; and then it was fine to,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
1213,MME,think of the poor after having heard good news.,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1214,ADOLPHE,It was neither fine nor anything else: it was something I,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
1215,ADOLPHE,did because I couldn't help myself. But something more occurred,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1216,ADOLPHE,"while I was in the church. I saw Maurice's girl friend, Jeanne,",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1217,ADOLPHE,"and her child. Struck down, crushed by his triumphal chariot, they",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1218,ADOLPHE,seemed aware of the full extent of their misfortune.,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1219,MME,"CATHERINE. Well, children, I don't know in what kind of shape",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
1220,MME,"you keep your consciences. But how a decent fellow, a careful and",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1221,MME,"considerate man like Monsieur Maurice, can all of a sudden desert",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1222,MME,"a woman and her child, that is something I cannot explain.",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1223,ADOLPHE,"Nor can I explain it, and he doesn't seem to understand",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
1224,ADOLPHE,"it himself. I met them this morning, and everything appeared quite",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1225,ADOLPHE,"natural to them, quite proper, as if they couldn't imagine",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1226,ADOLPHE,anything else. It was as if they had been enjoying the satisfaction,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1227,ADOLPHE,"of a good deed or the fulfilment of a sacred duty. There are things,",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1228,ADOLPHE,"Madame Catherine, that we cannot explain, and for this reason it",0.24,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,7/10
1229,ADOLPHE,"is not for us to judge. And besides, you saw how it happened.",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1230,ADOLPHE,Maurice felt the danger in the air. I foresaw it and tried to,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1231,ADOLPHE,"prevent their meeting. Maurice wanted to run away from it, but",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1232,ADOLPHE,"nothing helped. Why, it was as if a plot had been laid by some",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1233,ADOLPHE,"invisible power, and as if they had been driven by guile into",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1234,ADOLPHE,"each other's arms. Of course, I am disqualified in this case, but",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1235,ADOLPHE,"I wouldn't hesitate to pronounce a verdict of ""not guilty.""",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1236,MME,"CATHERINE. Well, now, to be able to forgive as you do, that's",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
1237,MME,what I call religion.,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1238,ADOLPHE,"Heavens, could it be that I am religious without knowing",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
1239,ADOLPHE,it.,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1240,MME,"CATHERINE. But then, to _let_ oneself be driven or tempted",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.7,R,8/10

1242,MME,"character. And if you feel your strength failing you, then you ask",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1243,MME,"for help, and then you get it. But he was too conceited to do",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1244,MME,"that--Who is this coming? The Abbé, I think.",0.14,0.6,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1245,ADOLPHE,What does he want here?,0.14,0.5,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
1246,ADOLPHE,"ABBÉ. [Enters] Good evening, madame. Good evening, Monsieur.",0.24,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,7/10
1247,MME,CATHERINE. Can I be of any service?,0.14,0.5,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
1248,MME,"ABBÉ. Has Monsieur Maurice, the author, been here to-day?",0.14,0.5,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1249,MME,"CATHERINE. Not to-day. His play has just been put on, and",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1250,MME,that is probably keeping him busy.,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1251,MME,ABBÉ. I have--sad news to bring him. Sad in several respects.,0.15,0.4,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1252,MME,CATHERINE. May I ask of what kind?,0.15,0.5,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1253,MME,"ABBÉ. Yes, it's no secret. The daughter he had with that girl,",0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1254,MME,"Jeanne, is dead.",0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1255,MME,CATHERINE. Dead!,0.15,0.45,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1256,ADOLPHE,Marion dead!,0.15,0.45,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
1257,ADOLPHE,"ABBÉ. Yes, she died suddenly this morning without any previous",0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1258,ADOLPHE,illness.,0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1259,MME,"CATHERINE. O Lord, who can tell Thy ways!",0.15,0.45,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
1260,MME,ABBÉ. The mother's grief makes it necessary that Monsieur Maurice,0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1261,MME,"look after her, so we must try to find him. But first a question",0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1262,MME,in confidence: do you know whether Monsieur Maurice was fond of,0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1263,MME,"the child, or was indifferent to it?",0.15,0.5,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1264,MME,"CATHERINE. If he was fond of Marion? Why, all of us know how",0.15,0.5,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1265,MME,he loved her.,0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1266,ADOLPHE,There's no doubt about that.,0.15,0.3,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
1267,ADOLPHE,"ABBÉ. I am glad to hear it, and it settles the matter so far as I",0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1268,ADOLPHE,am concerned.,0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1269,MME,CATHERINE. Has there been any doubt about it?,0.15,0.5,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
1270,MME,"ABBÉ. Yes, unfortunately. It has even been rumoured in the",0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1271,MME,neighbourhood that he had abandoned the child and its mother in,0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1272,MME,order to go away with a strange woman. In a few hours this rumour,0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1273,MME,"has grown into definite accusations, and at the same time the",0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1274,MME,feeling against him has risen to such a point that his life is,0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
1275,MME,threatened and he is being called a murderer.,0.25,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,7/10
1276,MME,"CATHERINE. Good God, what is _this_? What does it mean?",0.15,0.7,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1277,MME,ABBÉ. Now I'll tell you my opinion--I am convinced that the man is,0.15,0.4,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1278,MME,"innocent on this score, and the mother feels as certain about it",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1279,MME,"as I do. But appearances are against Monsieur Maurice, and I think",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1280,MME,he will find it rather hard to clear himself when the police come,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1281,MME,to question him.,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1282,ADOLPHE,Have the police got hold of the matter?,0.15,0.5,0.81,0.7,R,8/10
1283,ADOLPHE,"ABBÉ. Yea, the police have had to step in to protect him against",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1284,ADOLPHE,all those ugly rumours and the rage of the people. Probably the,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1285,ADOLPHE,Commissaire will be here soon.,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1286,MME,CATHERINE. [To ADOLPHE] There you see what happens when a man,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.7,R,8/10
1287,MME,"cannot tell the difference between good and evil, and when he",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1288,MME,trifles with vice. God will punish!,0.15,0.45,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1289,ADOLPHE,Then he is more merciless than man.,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.7,R,8/10
1290,ADOLPHE,ABBÉ. What do you know about that?,0.15,0.5,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1291,ADOLPHE,"Not very much, but I keep an eye on what happens--",0.15,0.4,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1292,ADOLPHE,ABBÉ. And you understand it also?,0.15,0.5,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1293,ADOLPHE,Not yet perhaps.,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1294,ADOLPHE,"ABBÉ. Let us look more closely at the matter--Oh, here comes the",0.15,0.4,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1295,ADOLPHE,Commissaire.,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1296,COMMISSAIRE,[Enters] Gentlemen--Madame Catherine--I have to,0.25,0.5,0.81,0.7,R,7/10
1297,COMMISSAIRE,trouble you for a moment with a few questions concerning Monsieur,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1298,COMMISSAIRE,"Maurice. As you have probably heard, he has become the object of a",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1299,COMMISSAIRE,"hideous rumour, which, by the by, I don't believe in.",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1300,MME,CATHERINE. None of us believes in it either.,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.7,R,8/10
1301,COMMISSAIRE,"That strengthens my own opinion, but for his own sake",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.7,R,8/10
1302,COMMISSAIRE,I must give him a chance to defend himself.,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1303,COMMISSAIRE,"ABBÉ. That's right, and I guess he will find justice, although it",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1304,COMMISSAIRE,may come hard.,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1305,COMMISSAIRE,"Appearances are very much against him, but I have",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1306,COMMISSAIRE,seen guiltless people reach the scaffold before their innocence,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1307,COMMISSAIRE,was discovered. Let me tell you what there is against him. The,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1308,COMMISSAIRE,"little girl, Marion, being left alone by her mother, was secretly",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1309,COMMISSAIRE,"visited by the father, who seems to have made sure of the time",0.25,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,7/10
1310,COMMISSAIRE,when the child was to be found alone. Fifteen minutes after his,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1311,COMMISSAIRE,visit the mother returned home and found the child dead. All this,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1312,COMMISSAIRE,makes the position of the accused man very unpleasant--The post-,0.15,0.4,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1313,COMMISSAIRE,"mortem examination brought out no signs of violence or of poison,",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1314,COMMISSAIRE,but the physicians admit the existence of new poisons that leave,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1315,COMMISSAIRE,no traces behind them. To me all this is mere coincidence of the,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1316,COMMISSAIRE,kind I frequently come across. But here's something that looks,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1317,COMMISSAIRE,worse. Last night Monsieur Maurice was seen at the Auberge des,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1318,COMMISSAIRE,"Adrets in company with a strange lady. According to the waiter,",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1319,COMMISSAIRE,they were talking about crimes. The Place de Roquette and the,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1320,COMMISSAIRE,scaffold were both mentioned. A queer topic of conversation for a,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1321,COMMISSAIRE,pair of lovers of good breeding and good social position! But even,0.15,0.45,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1322,COMMISSAIRE,"this may be passed over, as we know by experience that people who",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1323,COMMISSAIRE,have been drinking and losing a lot of sleep seem inclined to dig,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1324,COMMISSAIRE,up all the worst that lies at the bottom of their souls. Far more,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1325,COMMISSAIRE,serious is the evidence given by the head waiter as to their,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1326,COMMISSAIRE,champagne breakfast in the Bois de Boulogne this morning. He says,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1327,COMMISSAIRE,that he heard them wish the life out of a child. The man is said,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1328,COMMISSAIRE,"to have remarked that, ""It would be better if it had never",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1329,COMMISSAIRE,"existed."" To which the woman replied: ""Indeed! But now it does",0.15,0.45,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1330,COMMISSAIRE,"exist."" And as they went on talking, these words occurred: ""This",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1331,COMMISSAIRE,"will kill this!"" And the answer was: ""Kill! What kind of word is",0.25,0.6,0.81,0.2,R,7/10
1332,COMMISSAIRE,"that?"" And also: ""The five-spot of diamonds, the scaffold, the",0.15,0.5,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1333,COMMISSAIRE,"Place de Roquette."" All this, you see, will be hard to get out of,",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1334,COMMISSAIRE,and so will the foreign journey planned for this evening. These,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1335,COMMISSAIRE,are serious matters.,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1336,ADOLPHE,He is lost!,0.15,0.45,0.81,0.7,R,8/10
1337,MME,CATHERINE. That's a dreadful story. One doesn't know what to,0.16,0.3,0.81,0.7,R,8/10
1338,MME,believe.,0.16,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1339,MME,ABBÉ. This is not the work of man. God have mercy on him!,0.16,0.45,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1340,ADOLPHE,"He is in the net, and he will never get out of it.",0.16,0.3,0.81,0.7,R,8/10
1341,MME,CATHERINE. He had no business to get in.,0.16,0.3,0.81,0.7,R,8/10
1342,ADOLPHE,"Do you begin to suspect him also, Madame Catherine?",0.26,0.5,0.81,0.7,R,7/10
1343,MME,CATHERINE. Yes and no. I have got beyond having an opinion in,0.16,0.3,0.81,0.7,R,8/10
1344,MME,this matter. Have you not seen angels turn into devils just as you,0.16,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
1345,MME,"turn your hand, and then become angels again?",0.16,0.5,0.8,0.2,R,8/10
1346,COMMISSAIRE,"It certainly does look queer. However, we'll have to",0.16,0.3,0.8,0.7,R,8/10
1347,COMMISSAIRE,wait and hear what explanations he can give. No one will be judged,0.16,0.3,0.8,0.2,R,8/10
1348,COMMISSAIRE,"unheard. Good evening, gentlemen. Good evening, Madame Catherine.",0.26,0.3,0.8,0.2,R,7/10

1523,EMILE,"despicable to break one's promise, and it becomes unpardonable",0.18,0.3,0.78,0.2,R,8/10

1531,EMILE,punished by its consequences.,0.18,0.3,0.78,0.2,R,8/10
1532,JEANNE,Pray for him! For both of them!,0.18,0.6,0.78,0.7,R,8/10
1533,JEANNE,"ABBÉ. No, I'll do nothing of the kind, for it is an impertinence",0.18,0.3,0.78,0.2,R,8/10

1540,ADOLPHE,You believe then that he will come here?,0.18,0.5,0.78,0.7,R,8/10
1541,HENRIETTE,I am sure. He was released this noon for lack of,0.18,0.3,0.78,0.7,R,8/10
1542,HENRIETTE,"evidence, but he didn't want to show himself in the streets before",0.18,0.3,0.78,0.2,R,8/10
1543,HENRIETTE,it was dark.,0.18,0.3,0.78,0.2,R,8/10
1544,ADOLPHE,"Poor fellow! Oh, I tell you, life seems horrible to me",0.18,0.45,0.78,0.7,R,8/10
1545,ADOLPHE,since yesterday.,0.18,0.3,0.78,0.2,R,8/10
1546,HENRIETTE,"And what about me? I am afraid to live, dare hardly",0.18,0.5,0.78,0.7,R,8/10
1547,HENRIETTE,"breathe, dare hardly think even, since I know that somebody is",0.18,0.3,0.78,0.2,R,8/10
1548,HENRIETTE,spying not only on my words but on my thoughts.,0.18,0.3,0.78,0.2,R,8/10
1549,ADOLPHE,So it was here you sat that night when I couldn't find,0.18,0.3,0.78,0.7,R,8/10
1550,ADOLPHE,you?,0.18,0.5,0.78,0.2,R,8/10
1551,HENRIETTE,"Yes, but don't talk of it. I could die from shame when",0.18,0.3,0.78,0.7,R,8/10
1552,HENRIETTE,"I think of it. Adolphe, you are made of a different, a better,",0.28,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,7/10
1553,HENRIETTE,stuff than he or I--,0.18,0.4,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1554,ADOLPHE,"Sh, sh, sh!",0.18,0.45,0.77,0.7,R,8/10
1555,HENRIETTE,"Yes, indeed! And what was it that made me stay here? I",0.28,0.65,0.77,0.7,R,7/10
1556,HENRIETTE,was lazy; I was tired; his success intoxicated me and bewitched,0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1557,HENRIETTE,"me--I cannot explain it. But if you had come, it would never have",0.18,0.4,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1558,HENRIETTE,"happened. And to-day you are great, and he is small--less than the",0.18,0.4,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1559,HENRIETTE,least of all. Yesterday he had one hundred thousand francs. To-day,0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1560,HENRIETTE,"he has nothing, because his play has been withdrawn. And public",0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1561,HENRIETTE,"opinion will never excuse him, for his lack of faith will be",0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1562,HENRIETTE,"judged as harshly as if he were the murderer, and those that see",0.28,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,7/10
1563,HENRIETTE,"farthest hold that the child died from sorrow, so that he was",0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1564,HENRIETTE,responsible for it anyhow.,0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1565,ADOLPHE,"You know what my thoughts are in this matter, Henriette,",0.18,0.3,0.77,0.7,R,8/10
1566,ADOLPHE,but I should like to know that both of you are spotless. Won't you,0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1567,ADOLPHE,tell me what those dreadful words of yours meant? It cannot be a,0.18,0.5,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1568,ADOLPHE,chance that your talk in a festive moment like that dealt so,0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1569,ADOLPHE,largely with killing and the scaffold.,0.28,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,7/10
1570,HENRIETTE,"It was no chance. It was something that had to be said,",0.18,0.3,0.77,0.7,R,8/10
1571,HENRIETTE,something I cannot tell you--probably because I have no right to,0.18,0.4,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1572,HENRIETTE,"appear spotless in your eyes, seeing that I am not spotless.",0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1573,ADOLPHE,All this is beyond me.,0.18,0.3,0.77,0.7,R,8/10
1574,HENRIETTE,Let us talk of something else--Do you believe there are,0.18,0.4,0.77,0.7,R,8/10
1575,HENRIETTE,"many unpunished criminals at large among us, some of whom may even",0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1576,HENRIETTE,be our intimate friends?,0.18,0.5,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1577,ADOLPHE,[Nervously] Why? What do you mean?,0.18,0.7,0.77,0.7,R,8/10
1578,HENRIETTE,Don't you believe that every human being at some time,0.18,0.3,0.77,0.7,R,8/10
1579,HENRIETTE,or another has been guilty of some kind of act which would fall,0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1580,HENRIETTE,under the law if it were discovered?,0.18,0.5,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1581,ADOLPHE,"Yes, I believe that is true, but no evil act escapes",0.18,0.3,0.77,0.7,R,8/10
1582,ADOLPHE,being punished by one's own conscience at least. [Rises and,0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1583,ADOLPHE,unbuttons his coat] And--nobody is really good who has not erred.,0.18,0.4,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1584,ADOLPHE,have been in need of forgiveness--I had a friend whom we used to,0.18,0.4,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1585,ADOLPHE,regard as a model man. He never spoke a hard word to anybody; he,0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1586,ADOLPHE,forgave everything and everybody; and he suffered insults with a,0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1587,ADOLPHE,"strange satisfaction that we couldn't explain. At last, late in",0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1588,ADOLPHE,"life, he gave me his secret in a single word: I am a penitent! [He",0.18,0.45,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1589,ADOLPHE,sits down again.],0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1590,ADOLPHE,[As if speaking to himself] There are crimes not,0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1591,ADOLPHE,"mentioned in the Criminal Code, and these are the worse ones, for",0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1592,ADOLPHE,"they have to be punished by ourselves, and no judge could be more",0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1593,ADOLPHE,severe than we are against our own selves.,0.18,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1594,HENRIETTE,"[After a pause] Well, that friend of yours, did he find",0.18,0.3,0.77,0.7,R,8/10
1595,HENRIETTE,peace?,0.19,0.5,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1596,ADOLPHE,After endless self-torture he reached a certain degree of,0.19,0.3,0.77,0.7,R,8/10
1597,ADOLPHE,"composure, but life had never any real pleasures to offer him. He",0.19,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1598,ADOLPHE,never dared to accept any kind of distinction; he never dared to,0.19,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1599,ADOLPHE,feel himself entitled to a kind word or even well-earned praise:,0.19,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1600,ADOLPHE,"in a word, he could never quite forgive himself.",0.19,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1601,HENRIETTE,Never? What had he done then?,0.19,0.7,0.77,0.7,R,8/10
1602,ADOLPHE,He had wished the life out of his father. And when his,0.19,0.3,0.77,0.7,R,8/10
1603,ADOLPHE,"father suddenly died, the son imagined himself to have killed him.",0.29,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,7/10
1604,ADOLPHE,"Those imaginations were regarded as signs of some mental disease,",0.19,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1605,ADOLPHE,and he was sent to an asylum. From this he was discharged after a,0.19,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1606,ADOLPHE,time as wholly recovered--as they put it. But the sense of guilt,0.19,0.4,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1607,ADOLPHE,"remained with him, and so he continued to punish himself for his",0.19,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1608,ADOLPHE,evil thoughts.,0.19,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1609,HENRIETTE,Are you sure the evil will cannot kill?,0.29,0.5,0.77,0.7,R,7/10
1610,ADOLPHE,You mean in some mystic way?,0.19,0.5,0.77,0.7,R,8/10
1611,HENRIETTE,As you please. Let it go at mystic. In my own family--I,0.19,0.4,0.77,0.7,R,8/10
1612,HENRIETTE,am sure that my mother and my sisters killed my father with their,0.29,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,7/10
1613,HENRIETTE,"hatred. You see, he had the awful idea that he must oppose all our",0.19,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1614,HENRIETTE,"tastes and inclinations. Wherever he discovered a natural gift, he",0.19,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1615,HENRIETTE,tried to root it out. In that way he aroused a resistance that,0.19,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1616,HENRIETTE,accumulated until it became like an electrical battery charged,0.19,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1617,HENRIETTE,"with hatred. At last it grew so powerful that he languished away,",0.19,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1618,HENRIETTE,"became depolarised, lost his will-power, and, in the end, came to",0.19,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1619,HENRIETTE,wish himself dead.,0.19,0.3,0.77,0.2,R,8/10
1620,ADOLPHE,And your conscience never troubled you?,0.19,0.5,0.77,0.7,R,8/10
1621,HENRIETTE,"No, and furthermore, I don't know what conscience is.",0.19,0.3,0.76,0.7,R,8/10
1622,ADOLPHE,"You don't? Well, then you'll soon learn. [Pause] How do",0.19,0.5,0.76,0.7,R,8/10
1623,ADOLPHE,you believe Maurice will look when he gets here? What do you think,0.19,0.5,0.76,0.2,R,8/10
1624,ADOLPHE,he will say?,0.19,0.5,0.76,0.2,R,8/10
1625,HENRIETTE,"Yesterday morning, you know, he and I tried to make the",0.19,0.3,0.76,0.7,R,8/10
1626,HENRIETTE,same kind of guess about you while we were waiting for you.,0.19,0.3,0.76,0.2,R,8/10
1627,ADOLPHE,Well?,0.19,0.5,0.76,0.7,R,8/10
1628,HENRIETTE,We guessed entirely wrong.,0.19,0.3,0.76,0.7,R,8/10
1629,ADOLPHE,Can you tell me why you sent for me?,0.19,0.5,0.76,0.7,R,8/10
1630,HENRIETTE,"Malice, arrogance, outright cruelty!",0.19,0.45,0.76,0.7,R,8/10
1631,ADOLPHE,How strange it is that you can admit your faults and yet,0.19,0.3,0.76,0.7,R,8/10
1632,ADOLPHE,not repent of them.,0.19,0.3,0.76,0.2,R,8/10
1633,HENRIETTE,It must be because I don't feel quite responsible for,0.19,0.3,0.76,0.7,R,8/10
1634,HENRIETTE,them. They are like the dirt left behind by things handled during,0.19,0.3,0.76,0.2,R,8/10
1635,HENRIETTE,the day and washed off at night. But tell me one thing: do you,0.19,0.3,0.76,0.2,R,8/10
1636,HENRIETTE,really think so highly of humanity as you profess to do?,0.19,0.5,0.76,0.2,R,8/10
1637,ADOLPHE,"Yes, we are a little better than our reputation--and a",0.19,0.4,0.76,0.7,R,8/10
1638,ADOLPHE,little worse.,0.19,0.3,0.76,0.2,R,8/10
1639,HENRIETTE,That is not a straightforward answer.,0.19,0.3,0.76,0.7,R,8/10
1640,ADOLPHE,"No, it isn't. But are you willing to answer me frankly",0.19,0.3,0.76,0.7,R,8/10
1641,ADOLPHE,when I ask you: do you still love Maurice?,0.19,0.5,0.76,0.2,R,8/10
1642,HENRIETTE,I cannot tell until I see him. But at this moment I,0.19,0.3,0.76,0.7,R,8/10
1643,HENRIETTE,"feel no longing for him, and it seems as if I could very well live",0.19,0.3,0.76,0.2,R,8/10
1644,HENRIETTE,without him.,0.19,0.3,0.76,0.2,R,8/10
1645,ADOLPHE,"It's likely you could, but I fear you have become chained",0.19,0.3,0.76,0.7,R,8/10
1646,ADOLPHE,to his fate--Sh! Here he comes.,0.19,0.55,0.76,0.2,R,8/10
1647,HENRIETTE,How everything repeats itself. The situation is the,0.19,0.3,0.76,0.7,R,8/10
1648,HENRIETTE,"same, the very words are the same, as when we were expecting you",0.19,0.3,0.76,0.2,R,8/10

1660,MAURICE,wants to keep company with a murderer?,0.29,0.5,0.76,0.2,R,7/10
1661,HENRIETTE,But you have been cleared of the charge.,0.19,0.3,0.76,0.7,R,8/10

1666,HENRIETTE,mercy!,0.19,0.45,0.76,0.2,R,8/10
1667,MAURICE,And can you see that I actually look like a murderer? And,0.29,0.5,0.76,0.7,R,7/10
1668,MAURICE,then it is suggested that my play was stolen. So there isn't a,0.19,0.3,0.76,0.2,R,8/10

1674,HENRIETTE,So you don't know that Adolphe has made a great success,0.29,0.3,0.76,0.7,R,7/10

1686,MAURICE,You say that! What am I then to say? It is as if my eyes,0.2,0.65,0.76,0.7,R,8/10
1687,MAURICE,"had been covered with a black veil, and as if the colour and shape",0.2,0.3,0.76,0.2,R,8/10
1688,MAURICE,of all life had been changed by it. This room looks like the room,0.2,0.3,0.76,0.2,R,8/10

1691,MAURICE,search for words because I don't know what to say to you. I ought,0.2,0.3,0.75,0.2,R,8/10
1692,MAURICE,"to defend myself, but I cannot. And I almost miss the cell, for it",0.2,0.3,0.75,0.2,R,8/10

1698,ADOLPHE,Wait a little and get your thoughts together. That you,0.2,0.3,0.75,0.7,R,8/10
1699,ADOLPHE,have been discharged and cleared of all suspicion must appear in,0.2,0.3,0.75,0.2,R,8/10
1700,ADOLPHE,some of the evening papers. And that puts an end to the whole,0.2,0.3,0.75,0.2,R,8/10
1701,ADOLPHE,"matter. Your play will be put on again, and if it comes to the",0.2,0.3,0.75,0.2,R,8/10

1703,ADOLPHE,everything become forgotten. You who have exonerated mankind will,0.2,0.3,0.75,0.2,R,8/10
1704,ADOLPHE,be exonerated yourself.,0.2,0.3,0.75,0.2,R,8/10

1707,ADOLPHE,"I ever did believe in it. Perhaps it was only a mood, a manner of",0.2,0.3,0.75,0.2,R,8/10
1708,ADOLPHE,"looking at things, a way of being polite to the wild beasts. When",0.2,0.3,0.75,0.2,R,8/10
1709,ADOLPHE,"I, who was held among the best, can be so rotten to the core, what",0.2,0.3,0.75,0.2,R,8/10
1710,ADOLPHE,must then be the wretchedness of the rest?,0.2,0.5,0.75,0.2,R,8/10
1711,ADOLPHE,"Now I'll go out and get all the evening papers, and then",0.2,0.3,0.75,0.2,R,8/10
1712,ADOLPHE,we'll undoubtedly have reason to look at things in a different,0.2,0.3,0.75,0.2,R,8/10

1725,HENRIETTE,guiltlessness?,0.2,0.5,0.75,0.2,R,7/10
1726,MAURICE,I have killed nobody. All I did was to talk a lot of,0.3,0.3,0.75,0.7,L,6/10
1727,MAURICE,"nonsense while I was drunk. But it is your crime that comes back,",0.2,0.3,0.75,0.2,R,7/10
1728,MAURICE,and that crime you have grafted on to me.,0.2,0.3,0.75,0.2,R,7/10

1737,MAURICE,can never free myself? Guilty and guiltless; guiltless and yet,0.2,0.5,0.75,0.2,R,7/10
1738,MAURICE,"guilty! Oh, it is driving me mad--Look, now they sit over there",0.3,0.55,0.75,0.2,L,6/10
1739,MAURICE,and listen to us--And no waiter comes to take our order. I'll go,0.2,0.4,0.75,0.2,R,7/10
1740,MAURICE,out and order a cup of tea. Do you want anything?,0.2,0.5,0.75,0.2,R,7/10

1745,DETECTIVE,Dare? I'll show you!,0.2,0.65,0.75,0.7,R,7/10
1746,HENRIETTE,What do you mean?,0.2,0.5,0.75,0.7,R,7/10
1747,DETECTIVE,It's my job to keep an eye on street-walkers. Yesterday,0.2,0.3,0.75,0.7,R,7/10
1748,DETECTIVE,"you came here with one man, and today with another. That's as good",0.2,0.3,0.75,0.2,R,7/10
1749,DETECTIVE,as walking the streets. And unescorted ladies don't get anything,0.2,0.3,0.75,0.2,R,7/10

1777,MAURICE,Can it be possible that we have sunk so low?,0.21,0.5,0.74,0.7,R,7/10
1778,HENRIETTE,[Takes off a ring and hands it to the WAITER] The Abbé,0.21,0.3,0.74,0.7,R,7/10

1794,MAURICE,"there were still some task waiting for me, but I cannot make out",0.21,0.3,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1795,MAURICE,what it is.,0.21,0.3,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1796,HENRIETTE,But I can guess what it is.,0.21,0.3,0.74,0.7,R,7/10
1797,MAURICE,Tell me.,0.21,0.3,0.74,0.7,R,7/10
1798,HENRIETTE,"It is revenge. You, like me, must have suspected Jeanne",0.31,0.3,0.74,0.7,L,6/10
1799,HENRIETTE,and Emile of sending the detectives after me yesterday. Such a,0.21,0.3,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1800,HENRIETTE,revenge on a rival none but a woman could devise.,0.31,0.3,0.74,0.2,L,6/10
1801,MAURICE,Exactly what I was thinking. But let me tell you that my,0.21,0.3,0.74,0.7,R,7/10
1802,MAURICE,suspicions go even further. It seems as if my sufferings during,0.21,0.3,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1803,MAURICE,"these last few days had sharpened my wits. Can you explain, for",0.21,0.3,0.74,0.2,R,7/10

1806,MAURICE,hearing?,0.21,0.5,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1807,HENRIETTE,I never thought of it before. But now I know why. They,0.21,0.3,0.74,0.7,R,7/10
1808,HENRIETTE,"had nothing to tell, because they had not been listening.",0.21,0.3,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1809,MAURICE,But how could the Commissaire then know what we had been,0.21,0.3,0.74,0.7,R,7/10
1810,MAURICE,saying?,0.21,0.5,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1811,HENRIETTE,"He didn't know, but he figured it out. He was guessing,",0.21,0.3,0.74,0.7,R,7/10
1812,HENRIETTE,and he guessed right. Perhaps he had had to deal with some similar,0.21,0.3,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1813,HENRIETTE,case before.,0.21,0.3,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1814,MAURICE,Or else he concluded from our looks what we had been,0.21,0.3,0.74,0.7,R,7/10
1815,MAURICE,saying. There are those who can read other people's thoughts--,0.21,0.4,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1816,MAURICE,"Adolphe being the dupe, it seemed quite natural that we should",0.21,0.3,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1817,MAURICE,"have called him an ass. It's the rule, I understand, although it's",0.21,0.3,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1818,MAURICE,"varied at times by the use of ""idiot"" instead. But ass was nearer",0.21,0.3,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1819,MAURICE,"at hand in this case, as we had been talking of carriages and",0.21,0.3,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1820,MAURICE,triumphal chariots. It is quite simple to figure out a fourth,0.21,0.3,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1821,MAURICE,"fact, when you have three known ones to start from.",0.21,0.3,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1822,HENRIETTE,Just think that we have let ourselves be taken in so,0.21,0.3,0.74,0.7,R,7/10
1823,HENRIETTE,completely.,0.21,0.3,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1824,MAURICE,That's the result of thinking too well of one's fellow,0.21,0.3,0.74,0.7,R,7/10
1825,MAURICE,"beings. This is all you get out of it. But do you know, _I_",0.21,0.3,0.74,0.2,R,7/10
1826,MAURICE,"suspect somebody else back of the Commissaire, who, by-the-bye,",0.21,0.3,0.74,0.2,R,7/10

1831,MAURICE,confessions. And note you: Adolphe himself told us he had been at,0.21,0.3,0.73,0.2,R,7/10
1832,MAURICE,the Church of St. Germain that morning. What was he doing there?,0.21,0.5,0.73,0.2,R,7/10
1833,MAURICE,"He was blabbing, of course, and bewailing his fate. And then the",0.21,0.3,0.73,0.2,R,7/10
1834,MAURICE,priest put the questions together for the Commissaire.,0.21,0.3,0.73,0.2,R,7/10
1835,HENRIETTE,Tell me something: do you trust Adolphe?,0.21,0.5,0.73,0.7,R,7/10
1836,MAURICE,I trust no human being any longer.,0.21,0.3,0.73,0.7,R,7/10
1837,HENRIETTE,Not even Adolphe?,0.21,0.5,0.73,0.7,R,7/10
1838,MAURICE,Him least of all. How could I trust an enemy--a man from,0.21,0.4,0.73,0.7,R,7/10
1839,MAURICE,whom I have taken away his mistress?,0.21,0.5,0.73,0.2,R,7/10

1841,HENRIETTE,give you some data about our friend. You heard he had returned,0.21,0.3,0.73,0.2,R,7/10
1842,HENRIETTE,that medal from London. Do you know his reason for doing so?,0.21,0.5,0.73,0.2,R,7/10
1843,MAURICE,No.,0.21,0.3,0.73,0.7,R,7/10

1848,HENRIETTE,punishable under the law. That's what he gave me to understand,0.21,0.3,0.73,0.2,R,7/10

1886,HENRIETTE,Why did you lie to me?,0.22,0.5,0.73,0.7,R,7/10
1887,MAURICE,I wanted to spare you.,0.22,0.3,0.73,0.7,R,7/10

1927,HENRIETTE,And you are not there? What does that mean?,0.22,0.7,0.72,0.7,R,7/10
1928,MAURICE,It means that both Jeanne and the police have warned me,0.22,0.3,0.72,0.7,R,7/10

2509,ADOLPHE,"Like almost all other art, that of the stage has long seemed to me",0.29,0.3,0.64,0.2,R,7/10
2510,ADOLPHE,"a sort of _Biblia Pauperum_, or a Bible in pictures for those who",0.29,0.3,0.64,0.2,R,7/10
2511,ADOLPHE,cannot read what is written or printed. And in the same way the,0.29,0.3,0.64,0.2,R,7/10
2512,ADOLPHE,playwright has seemed to me a lay preacher spreading the thoughts,0.29,0.3,0.64,0.2,R,7/10
2513,ADOLPHE,"of his time in a form so popular that the middle classes, from",0.29,0.3,0.64,0.2,R,7/10
2514,ADOLPHE,"which theatrical audiences are mainly drawn, can know what is being",0.29,0.3,0.64,0.2,R,7/10
2515,ADOLPHE,talked about without troubling their brains too much. For this,0.29,0.3,0.64,0.2,R,7/10
2516,ADOLPHE,reason the theatre has always served as a grammar-school to young,0.29,0.3,0.64,0.2,R,7/10
2517,ADOLPHE,"people, women, and those who have acquired a little knowledge, all",0.29,0.3,0.64,0.2,R,7/10
2518,ADOLPHE,of whom retain the capacity for deceiving themselves and being,0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2519,ADOLPHE,deceived--which means again that they are susceptible to illusions,0.29,0.4,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2520,ADOLPHE,produced by the suggestions of the author. And for the same reason,0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2521,ADOLPHE,"I have had a feeling that, in our time, when the rudimentary,",0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2522,ADOLPHE,incomplete thought processes operating through our fancy seem to be,0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2523,ADOLPHE,"developing into reflection, research, and analysis, the theatre",0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2524,ADOLPHE,"might stand on the verge of being abandoned as a decaying form, for",0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2525,ADOLPHE,the enjoyment of which we lack the requisite conditions. The,0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2526,ADOLPHE,prolonged theatrical crisis now prevailing throughout Europe speaks,0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2527,ADOLPHE,"in favour of such a supposition, as well as the fact that, in the",0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2528,ADOLPHE,"civilised countries producing the greatest thinkers of the age,",0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10

2531,ADOLPHE,"In some other countries it has, however, been thought possible to",0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2532,ADOLPHE,create a new drama by filling the old forms with the contents of a,0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2533,ADOLPHE,"new time. But, for one thing, there has not been time for the new",0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2534,ADOLPHE,thoughts to become so popularized that the public might grasp the,0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2535,ADOLPHE,"questions raised; secondly, minds have been so inflamed by party",0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2536,ADOLPHE,conflicts that pure and disinterested enjoyment has been excluded,0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2537,ADOLPHE,from places where one's innermost feelings are violated and the,0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2538,ADOLPHE,tyranny of an applauding or hissing majority is exercised with the,0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2539,ADOLPHE,"openness for which the theatre gives a chance; and, finally, there",0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2540,ADOLPHE,"has been no new form devised for the new contents, and the new wine",0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2541,ADOLPHE,has burst the old bottles.,0.29,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2542,ADOLPHE,In the following drama I have not tried to do anything new--for,0.29,0.4,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2543,ADOLPHE,that cannot be done--but I have tried to modernize the form in,0.29,0.4,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2544,ADOLPHE,accordance with the demands which I thought the new men of a new,0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2545,ADOLPHE,time might be likely to make on this art. And with such a purpose,0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2546,ADOLPHE,"in view, I have chosen, or surrendered myself to, a theme that",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2547,ADOLPHE,might well be said to lie outside the partisan strife of the day:,0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2548,ADOLPHE,"for the problem of social ascendancy or decline, of higher or",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10

2550,ADOLPHE,"be of lasting interest. In selecting this theme from real life, as",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2551,ADOLPHE,"it was related to me a number of years ago, when the incident",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2552,ADOLPHE,"impressed me very deeply, I found it suited to a tragedy, because",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2553,ADOLPHE,it can only make us sad to see a fortunately placed individual,0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2554,ADOLPHE,"perish, and this must be the case in still higher degree when we",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2555,ADOLPHE,see an entire family die out. But perhaps a time will arrive when,0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2556,ADOLPHE,"we have become so developed, so enlightened, that we can remain",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2557,ADOLPHE,"indifferent before the spectacle of life, which now seems so",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2558,ADOLPHE,"brutal, so cynical, so heartless; when we have closed up those",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2559,ADOLPHE,"lower, unreliable instruments of thought which we call feelings,",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2560,ADOLPHE,and which have been rendered not only superfluous but harmful by,0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2561,ADOLPHE,the final growth of our reflective organs.,0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2562,ADOLPHE,The fact that the heroine arouses our pity depends only on our,0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2563,ADOLPHE,weakness in not being able to resist the sense of fear that the,0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2564,ADOLPHE,same fate could befall ourselves. And yet it is possible that a,0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2565,ADOLPHE,very sensitive spectator might fail to find satisfaction in this,0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2566,ADOLPHE,"kind of pity, while the man believing in the future might demand",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2567,ADOLPHE,"some positive suggestion for the abolition of evil, or, in other",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2568,ADOLPHE,"words, some kind of programme. But, first of all, there is no",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2569,ADOLPHE,absolute evil. That one family perishes is the fortune of another,0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2570,ADOLPHE,"family, which thereby gets a chance to rise. And the alternation of",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2571,ADOLPHE,"ascent and descent constitutes one of life's main charms, as",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2572,ADOLPHE,fortune is solely determined by comparison. And to the man with a,0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10

2574,ADOLPHE,"eats the dove, and the flea eats the hawk, I have this question to",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2575,ADOLPHE,put: why should it be remedied? Life is not so mathematically,0.3,0.5,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2576,ADOLPHE,"idiotic that it lets only the big eat the small, but it happens",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10

2579,ADOLPHE,That my tragedy makes a sad impression on many is their own fault.,0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2580,ADOLPHE,"When we grow strong as were the men of the first French revolution,",0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2581,ADOLPHE,then we shall receive an unconditionally good and joyful impression,0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2582,ADOLPHE,from seeing the national forests rid of rotting and superannuated,0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2583,ADOLPHE,trees that have stood too long in the way of others with equal,0.3,0.3,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2584,ADOLPHE,right to a period of free growth--an impression good in the same,0.3,0.4,0.63,0.2,R,7/10
2585,ADOLPHE,way as that received from the death of one incurably diseased.,0.4,0.3,0.63,0.2,L,6/10

2592,ADOLPHE,"cruel struggles, and my pleasure lies in knowing something and",0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2593,ADOLPHE,learning something. And for this reason I have selected an unusual,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2594,ADOLPHE,"but instructive case--an exception, in a word--but a great",0.3,0.5,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2595,ADOLPHE,"exception, proving the rule, which, of course, will provoke all",0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2596,ADOLPHE,lovers of the commonplace. And what also will offend simple brains,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2597,ADOLPHE,"is that my action cannot be traced back to a single motive, that",0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2598,ADOLPHE,the view-point is not always the same. An event in real life--and,0.3,0.4,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2599,ADOLPHE,this discovery is quite recent--springs generally from a whole,0.3,0.4,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2600,ADOLPHE,"series of more or less deep-lying motives, but of these the",0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2601,ADOLPHE,spectator chooses as a rule the one his reason can master most,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2602,ADOLPHE,"easily, or else the one reflecting most favourably on his power of",0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10

2604,ADOLPHE,"Unrequited love, say the ladies. Sickness, says the sick man.",0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2605,ADOLPHE,"Crushed hopes, says the shipwrecked. But now it may be that the",0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2606,ADOLPHE,motive lay in all or none of these directions. It is possible that,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2607,ADOLPHE,the one who is dead may have hid the main motive by pushing forward,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2608,ADOLPHE,another meant to place his memory in a better light.,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2609,ADOLPHE,In explanation of _Miss Julia's_ sad fate I have suggested many,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2610,ADOLPHE,factors: her mother's fundamental instincts; her father's mistaken,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2611,ADOLPHE,"upbringing of the girl; her own nature, and the suggestive influence",0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2612,ADOLPHE,"of her fiancé on a weak and degenerate brain; furthermore, and more",0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2613,ADOLPHE,directly: the festive mood of the Midsummer Eve; the absence of her,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2614,ADOLPHE,father; her physical condition; her preoccupation with the animals;,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2615,ADOLPHE,the excitation of the dance; the dusk of the night; the strongly,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2616,ADOLPHE,aphrodisiacal influence of the flowers; and lastly the chance,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2617,ADOLPHE,"forcing the two of them together in a secluded room, to which must",0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2618,ADOLPHE,be added the aggressiveness of the excited man.,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2619,ADOLPHE,Thus I have neither been one-sidedly physiological nor one-sidedly,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2620,ADOLPHE,psychological in my procedure. Nor have I merely delivered a moral,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2621,ADOLPHE,preachment. This multiplicity of motives I regard as praiseworthy,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2622,ADOLPHE,because it is in keeping with the views of our own time. And if,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2623,ADOLPHE,"others have done the same thing before me, I may boast of not being",0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2624,ADOLPHE,the sole inventor of my paradoxes--as all discoveries are named.,0.3,0.4,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2625,ADOLPHE,In regard to the character-drawing I may say that I have tried to,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2626,ADOLPHE,"make my figures rather ""characterless,"" and I have done so for",0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2627,ADOLPHE,reasons I shall now state.,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2628,ADOLPHE,In the course of the ages the word character has assumed many,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2629,ADOLPHE,meanings. Originally it signified probably the dominant ground-note,0.3,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2630,ADOLPHE,"in the complex mass of the self, and as such it was confused with",0.31,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2631,ADOLPHE,temperament. Afterward it became the middle-class term for an,0.31,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2632,ADOLPHE,"automaton, so that an individual whose nature had come to a stand",0.31,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2633,ADOLPHE,"still, or who had adapted himself to a certain part in life--who",0.31,0.4,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2634,ADOLPHE,"had ceased to grow, in a word--was named a character; while one",0.31,0.4,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2635,ADOLPHE,remaining in a state of development--a skilful navigator on life's,0.31,0.4,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2636,ADOLPHE,"river, who did not sail with close-tied sheets, but knew when to",0.31,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2637,ADOLPHE,fall off before the wind and when to luff again--was called lacking,0.31,0.4,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2638,ADOLPHE,"in character. And he was called so in a depreciatory sense, of",0.31,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2639,ADOLPHE,"course, because he was so hard to catch, to classify, and to keep",0.31,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2640,ADOLPHE,track of. This middle-class notion about the immobility of the soul,0.31,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2641,ADOLPHE,"was transplanted to the stage, where the middle-class element has",0.31,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2642,ADOLPHE,always held sway. There a character became synonymous with a,0.31,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2643,ADOLPHE,gentleman fixed and finished once for all--one who invariably,0.31,0.4,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2644,ADOLPHE,"appeared drunk, jolly, sad. And for the purpose of characterisation",0.31,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2645,ADOLPHE,nothing more was needed than some physical deformity like a,0.31,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2646,ADOLPHE,"clubfoot, a wooden leg, a red nose; or the person concerned was",0.31,0.3,0.62,0.2,L,6/10
2647,ADOLPHE,"made to repeat some phrase like ""That's capital!"" or ""Barkis is",0.41,0.45,0.62,0.2,L,5/10

2830,ADOLPHE,come to fear that our decreasing capacity for illusion might be,0.33,0.3,0.59,0.2,L,6/10

2926,ADOLPHE,I have placed the rear wall and the table diagonally across the,0.34,0.3,0.58,0.2,L,6/10

2934,ADOLPHE,faces of the actors look fatter. But I cannot help asking: why must,0.34,0.3,0.57,0.2,L,6/10
2935,ADOLPHE,all actors be fat in the face? Does not this light from below tend,0.34,0.5,0.57,0.2,L,6/10

2937,ADOLPHE,and especially around the jaws? Does it not give a false appearance,0.34,0.5,0.57,0.2,L,6/10
2938,ADOLPHE,to the nose and cast shadows upward over the eyes? If this be not,0.34,0.5,0.57,0.2,L,6/10
2939,ADOLPHE,"so, another thing is certain: namely, that the eyes of the actors",0.34,0.3,0.57,0.2,L,6/10

3821,JULIA,"occurred the day after our insurance expired, and the money sent",0.44,0.3,0.45,0.2,L,5/10
3822,JULIA,for renewal of the policy had been delayed by the messenger's,0.44,0.3,0.45,0.2,L,5/10
3823,JULIA,"carelessness, so that it came too late. [She fills her glass again",0.44,0.3,0.45,0.2,L,5/10

3826,JULIA,"Oh, what does it matter!--We were without a roof over our",0.44,0.55,0.45,0.7,L,5/10
3827,JULIA,heads and had to sleep in the carriages. My father didn't know,0.44,0.3,0.45,0.2,L,5/10
3828,JULIA,where to get money for the rebuilding of the house. Then my mother,0.44,0.3,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3829,JULIA,"suggested that he try to borrow from a childhood friend of hers, a",0.44,0.3,0.44,0.2,L,5/10

3831,JULIA,"loan, but was not permitted to pay any interest, which astonished",0.44,0.3,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3832,JULIA,him. And so the house was built up again. [Drinks again] Do you,0.44,0.3,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3833,JULIA,know who set fire to the house?,0.44,0.5,0.44,0.2,L,5/10

3840,JEAN,"In other words, to the count, if there was no settlement.",0.45,0.3,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3841,JULIA,There was no settlement. My mother possessed a small fortune,0.45,0.3,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3842,JULIA,"of her own which she did not want to leave in my father's control,",0.45,0.3,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3843,JULIA,so she invested it with--her friend.,0.45,0.4,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3844,JEAN,Who copped it.,0.45,0.3,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3845,JULIA,Exactly! He kept it. All this came to my father's knowledge.,0.45,0.45,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3846,JULIA,He couldn't bring suit; he couldn't pay his wife's lover; he,0.45,0.3,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3847,JULIA,couldn't prove that it was his wife's money. That was my mother's,0.45,0.3,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3848,JULIA,revenge because he had made himself master in his own house. At,0.65,0.3,0.44,0.2,P,3/10
3849,JULIA,that time he came near shooting himself--it was even rumoured that,0.45,0.4,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3850,JULIA,"he had tried and failed. But he took a new lease of life, and my",0.45,0.3,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3851,JULIA,mother had to pay for what she had done. I can tell you that those,0.45,0.3,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3852,JULIA,were five years I'll never forget! My sympathies were with my,0.45,0.45,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3853,JULIA,"father, but I took my mother's side because I was not aware of the",0.45,0.3,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3854,JULIA,true circumstances. From her I learned to suspect and hate men--for,0.45,0.4,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3855,JULIA,"she hated the whole sex, as you have probably heard--and I promised",0.45,0.4,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3856,JULIA,her on my oath that I would never become a man's slave.,0.45,0.3,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3857,JEAN,And so you became engaged to the County Attorney.,0.45,0.3,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3858,JULIA,"Yes, in order that he should be my slave.",0.45,0.3,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3859,JEAN,And he didn't want to?,0.45,0.5,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3860,JULIA,"Oh, he wanted, but I wouldn't let him. I got tired of him.",0.45,0.3,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3861,JEAN,"Yes, I saw it--in the stable-yard.",0.45,0.4,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3862,JULIA,What did you see?,0.45,0.5,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3863,JEAN,Just that--how he broke the engagement.,0.45,0.4,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3864,JULIA,"That's a lie! It was I who broke it. Did he say he did it,",0.45,0.45,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3865,JULIA,the scoundrel?,0.45,0.5,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3866,JEAN,"Oh, he was no scoundrel, I guess. So you hate men, Miss",0.45,0.3,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3867,JEAN,Julia?,0.45,0.5,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3868,JULIA,Yes! Most of the time. But now and then--when the weakness,0.45,0.55,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3869,JULIA,"comes over me--oh, what shame!",0.45,0.55,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3870,JEAN,And you hate me too?,0.45,0.5,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3871,JULIA,Beyond measure! I should like to kill you like a wild beast--,0.55,0.55,0.44,0.7,L,4/10
3872,JEAN,As you make haste to shoot a mad dog. Is that right?,0.55,0.5,0.44,0.7,L,4/10
3873,JULIA,That's right!,0.45,0.45,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3874,JEAN,But now there is nothing to shoot with--and there is no dog.,0.45,0.4,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3875,JEAN,What are we to do then?,0.45,0.5,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3876,JULIA,Go abroad.,0.45,0.3,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3877,JEAN,In order to plague each other to death?,0.55,0.5,0.44,0.7,L,4/10
3878,JULIA,"No-in order to enjoy ourselves: a couple of days, a week, as",0.45,0.3,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3879,JULIA,long as enjoyment is possible. And then--die!,0.45,0.55,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3880,JEAN,Die? How silly! Then I think it's much better to start a,0.45,0.65,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3881,JEAN,hotel.,0.45,0.3,0.44,0.2,L,5/10

3887,JEAN,"lot of villas that can be rented to loving couples, and that's a",0.45,0.3,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3888,JEAN,profitable business--do you know why? Because they take a lease for,0.45,0.6,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3889,JEAN,six months--and then they leave after three weeks.,0.45,0.4,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3890,JULIA,[Naïvely] Why after three weeks?,0.45,0.5,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3891,JEAN,"Because they quarrel, of course. But the rent has to be paid",0.45,0.3,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3892,JEAN,just the same. And then you can rent the house again. And that way,0.45,0.3,0.44,0.2,L,5/10
3893,JEAN,"it goes on all the time, for there is plenty of love--even if it",0.45,0.4,0.44,0.2,L,5/10

3895,JULIA,You don't want to die with me?,0.45,0.5,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3896,JEAN,"I don't want to die at all. Both because I am fond of living,",0.45,0.3,0.44,0.7,L,5/10
3897,JEAN,and because I regard suicide as a crime against the Providence,0.45,0.3,0.43,0.2,L,5/10
3898,JEAN,which has bestowed life on us.,0.45,0.3,0.43,0.2,L,5/10

3903,JULIA,So! And you think that will be enough for me? Do you know,0.45,0.65,0.43,0.7,L,5/10

4562,MRS,learned from you how to dress--_tant mieux_!--it has only given me,0.53,0.65,0.34,0.2,L,4/10

4569,MRS,now. You never got anything from me; you merely gave--and thus,0.53,0.4,0.34,0.2,L,4/10
4570,MRS,happened to me what happened to the thief--I had what you missed,0.53,0.4,0.34,0.2,L,4/10

4573,MRS,"keep a man's love, in spite of your tulips and your passions--and I",0.53,0.4,0.34,0.2,L,4/10
4574,MRS,could; you could never learn the art of living from the books--as I,0.53,0.4,0.34,0.2,L,4/10
4575,MRS,"learned it; you bore no little Eskil, although that was your",0.53,0.3,0.34,0.2,L,4/10

4591,MRS,"excelled unity of construction, its tremendous dramatic tension,",0.53,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10
4592,MRS,and its wonderful psychological analysis combine to make it a,0.53,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10

4595,MRS,"be either singular or plural, but it is rarely used except as a",0.53,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10
4596,MRS,plural. And the play itself makes it perfectly clear that the,0.53,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10

4599,MRS,One of the main objects of the play is to reveal her indebtedness,0.53,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10
4600,MRS,"first to one and then to the other of these men, while all the",0.53,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10

4602,MRS,"I have little doubt that Strindberg, at the time he wrote this",0.53,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10
4603,MRS,play--and bear in mind that this happened only a year before he,0.53,0.4,0.33,0.2,L,4/10
4604,MRS,finally decided to free himself from an impossible marriage by an,0.53,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10
4605,MRS,appeal to the law--believed _Tekla_ to be fairly representative of,0.53,0.4,0.33,0.2,L,4/10
4606,MRS,womanhood in general. The utter unreasonableness of such a view,0.53,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10
4607,MRS,"need hardly be pointed out, and I shall waste no time on it. A",0.53,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10
4608,MRS,question more worthy of discussion is whether the figure of _Tekla_,0.53,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10

4610,MRS,of numerous imaginable variations on a type decided not by sex but,0.53,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10
4611,MRS,by faculties and qualities. And the same question may well be,0.53,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10
4612,MRS,"raised in regard to the two men, both of whom are evidently",0.53,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10

4619,MRS,"however, that, in spite of his avowed realism, Strindberg did not",0.54,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10
4620,MRS,draw his men and women in the spirit generally designated as,0.54,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10
4621,MRS,"impressionistic; that is, with the idea that they might step",0.54,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10
4622,MRS,straight from his pages into life and there win recognition as,0.54,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10
4623,MRS,human beings of familiar aspect. His realism is always mixed with,0.54,0.3,0.33,0.2,L,4/10

4737,ADOLPH,you smiling at?,0.55,0.5,0.31,0.2,L,4/10

4740,GUSTAV,But from everybody else.,0.55,0.3,0.31,0.7,L,4/10
4741,ADOLPH,[After a pause] Yes.--And it looked as if she especially,0.55,0.4,0.31,0.7,L,4/10

4746,ADOLPH,"gave her ideas which they had taken directly from me, and then",0.55,0.3,0.31,0.2,L,4/10
4747,ADOLPH,they seemed all right. Everything was all right except what came,0.55,0.3,0.31,0.2,L,4/10
4748,ADOLPH,from me.,0.55,0.3,0.31,0.2,L,4/10
4749,GUSTAV,Which means that you are not entirely happy?,0.55,0.5,0.31,0.7,L,4/10
4750,ADOLPH,"Oh yes, I am happy. I have the one I wanted, and I have",0.55,0.3,0.31,0.7,L,4/10
4751,ADOLPH,never wanted anybody else.,0.55,0.3,0.31,0.2,L,4/10

4754,ADOLPH,imagined that it might seem like a rest to be free. But the moment,0.55,0.3,0.31,0.2,L,4/10
4755,ADOLPH,"she leaves me, I begin to long for her--long for her as for my own",0.55,0.4,0.31,0.2,L,4/10

4757,ADOLPH,"she is nothing in herself, but only a part of myself--an organ",0.55,0.4,0.31,0.2,L,4/10
4758,ADOLPH,"that can take away with it my will, my very desire to live. It",0.55,0.3,0.31,0.2,L,4/10

4762,GUSTAV,what has happened.,0.55,0.3,0.31,0.2,L,4/10
4763,ADOLPH,"How could it be so? Is she not an independent being, with",0.55,0.5,0.31,0.7,L,4/10
4764,ADOLPH,thoughts of her own? And when I met her I was nothing--a child of,0.55,0.6,0.31,0.2,L,4/10
4765,ADOLPH,an artist whom she undertook to educate.,0.55,0.3,0.31,0.2,L,4/10

4768,ADOLPH,"No, she stopped growing and I pushed on.",0.55,0.3,0.31,0.7,L,4/10
4769,GUSTAV,"Yes, isn't it strange that her ""authoring"" seemed to fall",0.55,0.3,0.31,0.7,L,4/10

4804,GUSTAV,"only to get her freedom. You see, a girl cannot have freedom",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4805,GUSTAV,except by providing herself with a chaperon--or what we call a,0.56,0.4,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4806,GUSTAV,husband.,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4807,ADOLPH,Of course not.,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.7,L,4/10
4808,GUSTAV,And now you are the chaperon.,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.7,L,4/10
4809,ADOLPH,I?,0.56,0.5,0.3,0.7,L,4/10
4810,GUSTAV,Since you are her husband.,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.7,L,4/10
4811,GUSTAV,Am I not right?,0.56,0.5,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4812,ADOLPH,"[Uneasily] I don't know. You live with a woman for years,",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.7,L,4/10
4813,ADOLPH,"and you never stop to analyse her, or your relationship with her,",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4814,ADOLPH,"and then--then you begin to think--and there you are!--Gustav, you",0.56,0.75,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4815,ADOLPH,are my friend. The only male friend I have. During this last week,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4816,ADOLPH,you have given me courage to live again. It is as if your own,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4817,ADOLPH,"magnetism had been poured into me. Like a watchmaker, you have",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4818,ADOLPH,fixed the works in my head and wound up the spring again. Can't,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4819,ADOLPH,"you hear, yourself, how I think more clearly and speak more to the",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4820,ADOLPH,point? And to myself at least it seems as if my voice had,0.56,0.5,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4821,ADOLPH,recovered its ring.,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4822,GUSTAV,So it seems to me also. And why is that?,0.56,0.5,0.3,0.7,L,4/10
4823,ADOLPH,I shouldn't wonder if you grew accustomed to lower your,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.7,L,4/10
4824,ADOLPH,voice in talking to women. I know at least that Tekla always used,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4825,ADOLPH,to accuse me of shouting.,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4826,GUSTAV,And so you toned down your voice and accepted the rule of,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.7,L,4/10
4827,GUSTAV,the slipper?,0.56,0.5,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4828,ADOLPH,That isn't quite the way to put it. [After some,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.7,L,4/10
4829,ADOLPH,reflection] I think it is even worse than that. But let us talk of,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4830,ADOLPH,"something else!--What was I saying?--Yes, you came here, and you",0.56,0.85,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4831,ADOLPH,"enabled me to see my art in its true light. Of course, for some",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4832,ADOLPH,"time I had noticed my growing lack of interest in painting, as it",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4833,ADOLPH,didn't seem to offer me the proper medium for the expression of,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4834,ADOLPH,"what I wanted to bring out. But when you explained all this to me,",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4835,ADOLPH,and made it clear why painting must fail as a timely outlet for,0.66,0.3,0.3,0.2,P,3/10
4836,ADOLPH,"the creative instinct, then I saw the light at last--and I",0.56,0.4,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4837,ADOLPH,realised that hereafter it would not be possible for me to express,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4838,ADOLPH,myself by means of colour only.,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4839,GUSTAV,Are you quite sure now that you cannot go on painting--,0.56,0.4,0.3,0.7,L,4/10
4840,GUSTAV,that you may not have a relapse?,0.56,0.5,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4841,ADOLPH,Perfectly sure! For I have tested myself. When I went to,0.56,0.45,0.3,0.7,L,4/10
4842,ADOLPH,"bed that night after our talk, I rehearsed your argument point by",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4843,ADOLPH,"point, and I knew you had it right. But when I woke up from a good",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4844,ADOLPH,"night's sleep and my head was clear again, then it came over me in",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4845,ADOLPH,a flash that you might be mistaken after all. And I jumped out of,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4846,ADOLPH,bed and got hold of my brushes and paints--but it was no use!,0.56,0.55,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4847,ADOLPH,Every trace of illusion was gone--it was nothing but smears of,0.56,0.4,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4848,ADOLPH,"paint, and I quaked at the thought of having believed, and having",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4849,ADOLPH,"made others believe, that a painted canvas could be anything but a",0.66,0.3,0.3,0.2,P,3/10
4850,ADOLPH,"painted canvas. The veil had fallen from my eyes, and it was just",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4851,ADOLPH,as impossible for me to paint any more as it was to become a child,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4852,ADOLPH,again.,0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4853,GUSTAV,"And then you saw that the realistic tendency of our day,",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.7,L,4/10
4854,GUSTAV,"its craving for actuality and tangibility, could only find its",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4855,GUSTAV,"proper form in sculpture, which gives you body, extension in all",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4856,GUSTAV,three dimensions--,0.56,0.4,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4857,ADOLPH,"[Vaguely] The three dimensions--oh yes, body, in a word!",0.56,0.55,0.3,0.7,L,4/10
4858,GUSTAV,"And then you became a sculptor yourself. Or rather, you",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.7,L,4/10
4859,GUSTAV,"have been one all your life, but you had gone astray, and nothing",0.56,0.3,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4860,GUSTAV,"was needed but a guide to put you on the right road--Tell me, do",0.56,0.4,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4861,GUSTAV,you experience supreme joy now when you are at work?,0.56,0.5,0.3,0.2,L,4/10
4862,ADOLPH,Now I am living!,0.56,0.45,0.3,0.7,L,4/10
4863,GUSTAV,May I see what you are doing?,0.56,0.5,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4864,ADOLPH,A female figure.,0.56,0.3,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4865,GUSTAV,Without a model? And so lifelike at that!,0.56,0.65,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4866,ADOLPH,"[Apathetically] Yes, but it resembles somebody. It is",0.56,0.3,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4867,ADOLPH,remarkable that this woman seems to have become a part of my body,0.56,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4868,ADOLPH,as I of hers.,0.56,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4869,GUSTAV,"Well, that's not so very remarkable. Do you know what",0.56,0.3,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4870,GUSTAV,transfusion is?,0.56,0.5,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4871,ADOLPH,Of blood? Yes.,0.66,0.5,0.29,0.7,P,3/10
4872,GUSTAV,And you seem to have bled yourself a little too much. When,0.57,0.3,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4873,GUSTAV,I look at the figure here I comprehend several things which I,0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4874,GUSTAV,merely guessed before. You have loved her tremendously!,0.57,0.45,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4875,ADOLPH,"Yes, to such an extent that I couldn't tell whether she",0.57,0.3,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4876,ADOLPH,"was I or I she. When she is smiling, I smile also. When she is",0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4877,ADOLPH,"weeping, I weep. And when she--can you imagine anything like it?--",0.57,0.7,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4878,ADOLPH,when she was giving life to our child--I felt the birth pangs,0.57,0.4,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4879,ADOLPH,within myself.,0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4880,GUSTAV,"Do you know, my dear friend--I hate to speak of it, but",0.57,0.4,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4881,GUSTAV,you are already showing the first symptoms of epilepsy.,0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4882,ADOLPH,[Agitated] I! How can you tell?,0.57,0.65,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4883,GUSTAV,Because I have watched the symptoms in a younger brother,0.57,0.3,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4884,GUSTAV,of mine who had been worshipping Venus a little too excessively.,0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4885,ADOLPH,How--how did it show itself--that thing you spoke of?,0.57,0.7,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4886,ADOLPH,"and ADOLPH listens so intently that, unconsciously, he imitates",0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10

4888,GUSTAV,"It was dreadful to witness, and if you don't feel strong",0.57,0.3,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4889,GUSTAV,enough I won't inflict a description of it on you.,0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4890,ADOLPH,"[Nervously] Yes, go right on--just go on!",0.57,0.55,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4891,GUSTAV,"Well, the boy happened to marry an innocent little",0.57,0.3,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4892,GUSTAV,"creature with curls, and eyes like a turtle-dove; with the face of",0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4893,GUSTAV,a child and the pure soul of an angel. But nevertheless she,0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4894,GUSTAV,managed to usurp the male prerogative--,0.57,0.4,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4895,ADOLPH,What is that?,0.57,0.5,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4896,GUSTAV,"Initiative, of course. And with the result that the angel",0.57,0.3,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4897,GUSTAV,nearly carried him off to heaven. But first he had to be put on,0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4898,GUSTAV,the cross and made to feel the nails in his flesh. It was,0.67,0.3,0.29,0.2,P,3/10
4899,GUSTAV,horrible!,0.57,0.45,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4900,ADOLPH,"[Breathlessly] Well, what happened?",0.57,0.5,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4901,GUSTAV,[Lingering on each word] We might be sitting together,0.57,0.3,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4902,GUSTAV,"talking, he and I--and when I had been speaking for a while his",0.57,0.4,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4903,GUSTAV,"face would turn white as chalk, his arms and legs would grow",0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4904,GUSTAV,"stiff, and his thumbs became twisted against the palms of his",0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4905,GUSTAV,hands--like this. [He illustrates the movement and it is imitated,0.57,0.4,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4906,GUSTAV,"by ADOLPH] Then his eyes became bloodshot, and he began to chew--",0.67,0.4,0.29,0.2,P,3/10
4907,GUSTAV,"like this. [He chews, and again ADOLPH imitates him] The saliva",0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4908,GUSTAV,was rattling in his throat. His chest was squeezed together as if,0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4909,GUSTAV,it had been closed in a vice. The pupils of his eyes flickered,0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4910,GUSTAV,"like gas-jets. His tongue beat the saliva into a lather, and he",0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4911,GUSTAV,sank--slowly--down--backward--into the chair--as if he were,0.57,0.8,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4912,GUSTAV,drowning. And then--,0.57,0.4,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4913,ADOLPH,[In a whisper] Stop now!,0.57,0.45,0.29,0.7,L,4/10

4917,GUSTAV,we'll talk of something else.,0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4918,ADOLPH,[Feebly] Thank you! Please go on!,0.57,0.6,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4919,GUSTAV,Well--when he came to he couldn't remember anything at,0.57,0.4,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4920,GUSTAV,all. He had simply lost consciousness. Has that ever happened to,0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10

4924,GUSTAV,"Well, that's the beginning of it, you know. But, believe",0.57,0.3,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4925,GUSTAV,"me, it will end in epilepsy if you don't take care of yourself.",0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4926,ADOLPH,What can I do?,0.57,0.5,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4927,GUSTAV,"To begin with, you will have to observe complete",0.57,0.3,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4928,GUSTAV,abstinence.,0.57,0.3,0.29,0.2,L,4/10
4929,ADOLPH,For how long?,0.57,0.5,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4930,GUSTAV,For half a year at least.,0.57,0.3,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4931,ADOLPH,I cannot do it. That would upset our married life.,0.57,0.3,0.29,0.7,L,4/10
4932,GUSTAV,Good-bye to you then!,0.57,0.45,0.28,0.7,L,4/10

4934,GUSTAV,"Can you not save your own life?--But tell me, as you have",0.57,0.6,0.28,0.7,L,4/10
4935,GUSTAV,already given me so much of your confidence--is there no other,0.57,0.4,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4936,GUSTAV,"canker, no secret wound, that troubles you? For it is very rare to",0.57,0.5,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4937,GUSTAV,"find only one cause of discord, as life is so full of variety and",0.57,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4938,GUSTAV,so fruitful in chances for false relationships. Is there not a,0.57,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4939,GUSTAV,corpse in your cargo that you are trying to hide from yourself?--,0.57,0.6,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4940,GUSTAV,"For instance, you said a minute ago that you have a child which",0.57,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4941,GUSTAV,has been left in other people's care. Why don't you keep it with,0.57,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10

4943,ADOLPH,My wife doesn't want us to do so.,0.57,0.3,0.28,0.7,L,4/10
4944,GUSTAV,And her reason? Speak up now!,0.57,0.65,0.28,0.7,L,4/10

4947,GUSTAV,Well? Have you seen her former husband?,0.57,0.7,0.28,0.7,L,4/10
4948,ADOLPH,"No, never. I have only had a casual glance at a very poor",0.57,0.3,0.28,0.7,L,4/10

4953,GUSTAV,hope it hasn't aroused any suspicions in you?,0.57,0.5,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4954,ADOLPH,"Not at all. The child was born a year after our marriage,",0.57,0.3,0.28,0.7,L,4/10

4967,ADOLPH,thought.,0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4968,GUSTAV,There now!--And you'll never get rid of it. There are,0.58,0.55,0.28,0.7,L,4/10

4970,GUSTAV,this reason you had better put wax in your ears and go to work. If,0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4971,GUSTAV,"you work, and grow old, and pile masses of new impressions on the",0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4972,GUSTAV,"hatches, then the corpse will stay quiet in the hold.",0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4973,ADOLPH,"Pardon me for interrupting you, but--it is wonderful how",0.58,0.4,0.28,0.7,L,4/10
4974,ADOLPH,you resemble Tekla now and then while you are talking. You have a,0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4975,ADOLPH,"way of blinking one eye as if you were taking aim with a gun, and",0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4976,ADOLPH,your eyes have the same influence on me as hers have at times.,0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4977,GUSTAV,"No, really?",0.58,0.5,0.28,0.7,L,4/10
4978,ADOLPH,"And now you said that ""no, really"" in the same indifferent",0.58,0.3,0.28,0.7,L,4/10
4979,ADOLPH,"way that she does. She also has the habit of saying ""no, really""",0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4980,ADOLPH,quite often.,0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4981,GUSTAV,"Perhaps we are distantly related, seeing that all human",0.58,0.3,0.28,0.7,L,4/10
4982,GUSTAV,"beings are said to be of one family. At any rate, it will be",0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4983,GUSTAV,interesting to make your wife's acquaintance to see if what you,0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4984,GUSTAV,say is true.,0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4985,ADOLPH,"And do you know, she never takes an expression from me.",0.58,0.3,0.28,0.7,L,4/10
4986,ADOLPH,"She seems rather to avoid my vocabulary, and I have never caught",0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4987,ADOLPH,her using any of my gestures. And yet people as a rule develop,0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4988,ADOLPH,"what is called ""marital resemblance.""",0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4989,GUSTAV,And do you know why this has not happened in your case?--,0.58,0.6,0.28,0.7,L,4/10
4990,GUSTAV,That woman has never loved you.,0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4991,ADOLPH,What do you mean?,0.58,0.5,0.28,0.7,L,4/10
4992,GUSTAV,I hope you will excuse what I am saying--but woman's love,0.58,0.4,0.28,0.7,L,4/10
4993,GUSTAV,"consists in taking, in receiving, and one from whom she takes",0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4994,GUSTAV,nothing does not have her love. She has never loved you!,0.58,0.45,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4995,ADOLPH,Don't you think her capable of loving more than once?,0.58,0.5,0.28,0.7,L,4/10
4996,GUSTAV,"No, for we cannot be deceived more than once. Then our",0.58,0.3,0.28,0.7,L,4/10
4997,GUSTAV,"eyes are opened once for all. You have never been deceived, and so",0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4998,GUSTAV,"you had better beware of those that have. They are dangerous, I",0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
4999,GUSTAV,tell you.,0.58,0.3,0.28,0.2,L,4/10
5000,ADOLPH,"Your words pierce me like knife thrusts, and I fool as if",0.58,0.3,0.28,0.7,L,4/10
5001,ADOLPH,"something were being severed within me, but I cannot help it. And",0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5002,ADOLPH,"this cutting brings a certain relief, too. For it means the",0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5003,ADOLPH,pricking of ulcers that never seemed to ripen.--She has never,0.58,0.4,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5004,ADOLPH,"loved me!--Why, then, did she ever take me?",0.58,0.75,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5005,GUSTAV,"Tell me first how she came to take you, and whether it was",0.58,0.3,0.27,0.7,L,4/10
5006,GUSTAV,you who took her or she who took you?,0.58,0.5,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5007,ADOLPH,Heaven only knows if I can tell at all!--How did it,0.58,0.55,0.27,0.7,L,4/10
5008,ADOLPH,"happen? Well, it didn't come about in one day.",0.58,0.5,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5009,GUSTAV,Would you like to have me tell you how it did happen?,0.58,0.5,0.27,0.7,L,4/10
5010,ADOLPH,That's more than you can do.,0.58,0.3,0.27,0.7,L,4/10
5011,GUSTAV,"Oh, by using the information about yourself and your wife",0.58,0.3,0.27,0.7,L,4/10
5012,GUSTAV,"that you have given me, I think I can reconstruct the whole event.",0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5013,GUSTAV,"Listen now, and you'll hear. [In a dispassionate tone, almost",0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5014,GUSTAV,"humorously] The husband had gone abroad to study, and she was",0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5015,GUSTAV,alone. At first her freedom seemed rather pleasant. Then came a,0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5016,GUSTAV,"sense of vacancy, for I presume she was pretty empty when she had",0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5017,GUSTAV,"lived by herself for a fortnight. Then _he_ appeared, and by and by",0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5018,GUSTAV,the vacancy was filled up. By comparison the absent one seemed to,0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5019,GUSTAV,"fade out, and for the simple reason that he was at a distance--you",0.58,0.4,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5020,GUSTAV,know the law about the square of the distance? But when they felt,0.58,0.5,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5021,GUSTAV,"their passions stirring, then came fear--of themselves, of their",0.58,0.4,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5022,GUSTAV,"consciences, of him. For protection they played brother and",0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5023,GUSTAV,"sister. And the more their feelings smacked of the flesh, the more",0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5024,GUSTAV,they tried to make their relationship appear spiritual.,0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5025,ADOLPH,Brother and sister? How could you know that?,0.58,0.7,0.27,0.7,L,4/10
5026,GUSTAV,I guessed it. Children are in the habit of playing papa,0.58,0.3,0.27,0.7,L,4/10
5027,GUSTAV,"and mamma, but when they grow up they play brother and sister--in",0.58,0.4,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5028,GUSTAV,order to hide what should be hidden!--And then they took the vow,0.58,0.55,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5029,GUSTAV,of chastity--and then they played hide-and-seek--until they got,0.58,0.5,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5030,GUSTAV,in a dark corner where they were sure of not being seen by,0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5031,GUSTAV,anybody. [With mock severity] But they felt that there was _one_,0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5032,GUSTAV,whose eye reached them in the darkness--and they grew frightened--,0.58,0.5,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5033,GUSTAV,and their fright raised the spectre of the absent one--his figure,0.58,0.4,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5034,GUSTAV,began to assume immense proportions--it became metamorphosed:,0.58,0.4,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5035,GUSTAV,turned into a nightmare that disturbed their amorous slumbers; a,0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5036,GUSTAV,creditor who knocked at all doors. Then they saw his black hand,0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5037,GUSTAV,between their own as these sneaked toward each other across the,0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5038,GUSTAV,table; and they heard his grating voice through that stillness of,0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5039,GUSTAV,the night that should have been broken only by the beating of,0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5040,GUSTAV,their own pulses. He did not prevent them from possessing each,0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5041,GUSTAV,other but he spoiled their happiness. And when they became aware,0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5042,GUSTAV,of his invisible interference with their happiness; when they took,0.58,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5043,GUSTAV,"flight at last--a vain flight from the memories that pursued them,",0.58,0.4,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5044,GUSTAV,"from the liability they had left behind, from the public opinion",0.59,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5045,GUSTAV,they could not face--and when they found themselves without the,0.59,0.4,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5046,GUSTAV,"strength needed to carry their own guilt, then they had to send",0.59,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5047,GUSTAV,out into the fields for a scapegoat to be sacrificed. They were,0.59,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5048,GUSTAV,"free-thinkers, but they did not have the courage to step forward",0.59,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5049,GUSTAV,"and speak openly to him the words: ""We love each other!"" To sum it",0.59,0.45,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5050,GUSTAV,"up, they were cowards, and so the tyrant had to be slaughtered. Is",0.59,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5051,GUSTAV,that right?,0.59,0.5,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5052,ADOLPH,"Yes, but you forget that she educated me, that she filled",0.59,0.3,0.27,0.7,L,4/10
5053,ADOLPH,my head with new thoughts--,0.59,0.4,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5054,GUSTAV,I have not forgotten it. But tell me: why could she not,0.59,0.3,0.27,0.7,L,4/10
5055,GUSTAV,educate the other man also--into a free-thinker?,0.59,0.6,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5056,ADOLPH,"Oh, he was an idiot!",0.59,0.45,0.27,0.7,L,4/10
5057,GUSTAV,"Oh, of course--he was an idiot! But that's rather an",0.59,0.55,0.27,0.7,L,4/10
5058,GUSTAV,"ambiguous term, and, as pictured in her novel, his idiocy seems",0.59,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5059,GUSTAV,mainly to have consisted in failure to understand her. Pardon me a,0.59,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5060,GUSTAV,question: but is your wife so very profound after all? I have,0.59,0.5,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5061,GUSTAV,discovered nothing profound in her writings.,0.59,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5062,ADOLPH,Neither have I.--But then I have also to confess a certain,0.59,0.4,0.27,0.7,L,4/10
5063,ADOLPH,difficulty in understanding her. It is as if the cogs of our brain,0.59,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5064,ADOLPH,"wheels didn't fit into each other, and as if something went to",0.59,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5065,ADOLPH,pieces in my head when I try to comprehend her.,0.59,0.3,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5066,GUSTAV,"Maybe you are an idiot, too?",0.59,0.5,0.27,0.7,L,4/10
5067,ADOLPH,I don't _think_ so! And it seems to me all the time as if,0.59,0.45,0.27,0.7,L,4/10
5068,ADOLPH,"she were in the wrong--Would you care to read this letter, for",0.59,0.4,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5069,ADOLPH,"instance, which I got today?",0.59,0.5,0.27,0.2,L,4/10
5070,GUSTAV,[Glancing through the letter] Hm! The handwriting seems,0.59,0.45,0.26,0.7,L,4/10
5071,GUSTAV,strangely familiar.,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5072,ADOLPH,"Rather masculine, don't you think?",0.59,0.5,0.26,0.7,L,4/10
5073,GUSTAV,"Well, I know at least _one_ man who writes that kind of",0.59,0.3,0.26,0.7,L,4/10
5074,GUSTAV,"hand--She addresses you as ""brother."" Are you still playing",0.59,0.4,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5075,GUSTAV,comedy to each other? And do you never permit yourselves any,0.59,0.5,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5076,GUSTAV,greater familiarity in speaking to each other?,0.59,0.5,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5077,ADOLPH,"No, it seems to me that all mutual respect is lost in that",0.59,0.3,0.26,0.7,L,4/10
5078,ADOLPH,way.,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5079,GUSTAV,And is it to make you respect her that she calls herself,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.7,L,4/10
5080,GUSTAV,your sister?,0.59,0.5,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5081,ADOLPH,I want to respect her more than myself. I want her to be,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.7,L,4/10
5082,ADOLPH,the better part of my own self.,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5083,GUSTAV,Why don't you be that better part yourself? Would it be,0.59,0.5,0.26,0.7,L,4/10
5084,GUSTAV,less convenient than to permit somebody else to fill the part? Do,0.59,0.5,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5085,GUSTAV,you want to place yourself beneath your wife?,0.59,0.5,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5086,ADOLPH,"Yes, I do. I take a pleasure in never quite reaching up to",0.59,0.3,0.26,0.7,L,4/10
5087,ADOLPH,"her. I have taught her to swim, for example, and now I enjoy",0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5088,ADOLPH,hearing her boast that she surpasses me both in skill and daring.,0.69,0.3,0.26,0.2,P,3/10
5089,ADOLPH,"To begin with, I merely pretended to be awkward and timid in order",0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5090,ADOLPH,to raise her courage. And so it ended with my actually being her,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5091,ADOLPH,"inferior, more of a coward than she. It almost seemed to me as if",0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5092,ADOLPH,she had actually taken my courage away from me.,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5093,GUSTAV,Have you taught her anything else?,0.59,0.5,0.26,0.7,L,4/10
5094,ADOLPH,Yes--but it must stay between us--I have taught her how to,0.59,0.5,0.26,0.7,L,4/10
5095,ADOLPH,"spell, which she didn't know before. But now, listen: when she",0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5096,ADOLPH,"took charge of our domestic correspondence, I grew out of the",0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5097,ADOLPH,"habit of writing. And think of it: as the years passed on, lack of",0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5098,ADOLPH,practice made me forget a little here and there of my grammar. But,0.69,0.3,0.26,0.2,P,3/10
5099,ADOLPH,do you think she recalls that I was the one who taught her at the,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5100,ADOLPH,"start? No--and so I am ""the idiot,"" of course.",0.59,0.6,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5101,GUSTAV,So you _are_ an idiot already?,0.59,0.5,0.26,0.7,L,4/10
5102,ADOLPH,"Oh, it's just a joke, of course!",0.59,0.45,0.26,0.7,L,4/10
5103,GUSTAV,"Of course! But this is clear cannibalism, I think. Do you",0.59,0.45,0.26,0.7,L,4/10
5104,GUSTAV,know what's behind that sort of practice? The savages eat their,0.59,0.5,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5105,GUSTAV,enemies in order to acquire their useful qualities. And this woman,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5106,GUSTAV,"has been eating your soul, your courage, your knowledge--",0.59,0.4,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5107,ADOLPH,And my faith! It was I who urged her to write her first,0.59,0.45,0.26,0.7,L,4/10
5108,ADOLPH,book--,0.59,0.4,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5109,GUSTAV,[Making a face] Oh-h-h!,0.59,0.45,0.26,0.7,L,4/10
5110,ADOLPH,"It was I who praised her, even when I found her stuff",0.59,0.3,0.26,0.7,L,4/10
5111,ADOLPH,rather poor. It was I who brought her into literary circles where,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5112,ADOLPH,she could gather honey from our most ornamental literary flowers.,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5113,ADOLPH,It was I who used my personal influence to keep the critics from,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5114,ADOLPH,her throat. It was I who blew her faith in herself into flame;,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5115,ADOLPH,"blew on it until I lost my own breath. I gave, gave, gave--until I",0.59,0.4,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5116,ADOLPH,had nothing left for myself. Do you know--I'll tell you everything,0.59,0.4,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5117,ADOLPH,now--do you know I really believe--and the human soul is so,0.59,0.5,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5118,ADOLPH,peculiarly constituted--I believe that when my artistic successes,0.59,0.4,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5119,ADOLPH,seemed about to put her in the shadow--as well as her reputation--,0.59,0.5,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5120,ADOLPH,"then I tried to put courage into her by belittling myself, and by",0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5121,ADOLPH,making my own art seem inferior to hers. I talked so long about,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5122,ADOLPH,the insignificant part played by painting on the whole--talked so,0.59,0.4,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5123,ADOLPH,"long about it, and invented so many reasons to prove what I said,",0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5124,ADOLPH,that one fine day I found myself convinced of its futility. So all,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5125,ADOLPH,you had to do was to breathe on a house of cards.,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5126,GUSTAV,Pardon me for recalling what you said at the beginning of,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.7,L,4/10
5127,GUSTAV,our talk--that she had never taken anything from you.,0.59,0.4,0.26,0.2,L,4/10
5128,ADOLPH,She doesn't nowadays. Because there is nothing more to,0.59,0.3,0.26,0.7,L,4/10

5727,ADOLPH,the storm swept over us? Then you lay there like an infant in arms,0.66,0.5,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5728,ADOLPH,"and just cried. Then you had to sit on my lap, and I had to kiss",0.66,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5729,ADOLPH,your eyes to sleep. Then I had to be your nurse; had to see that,0.66,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5730,ADOLPH,you fixed your hair before going out; had to send your shoes to,0.66,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10

5734,ADOLPH,"single friend, and because you were crushed by the hostility of",0.67,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5735,ADOLPH,public opinion. I had to talk courage into you until my mouth was,0.67,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5736,ADOLPH,dry and my head ached. I had to make myself believe that I was,0.67,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5737,ADOLPH,strong. I had to force myself into believing in the future. And so,0.67,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5738,ADOLPH,"I brought you back to life, when you seemed already dead. Then you",0.67,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5739,ADOLPH,admired me. Then I was the man--not that kind of athlete you had,0.67,0.4,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5740,ADOLPH,"just left, but the man of will-power, the mesmerist who instilled",0.67,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10

5742,ADOLPH,brain with a new store of electricity. And then I gave you back,0.67,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5743,ADOLPH,"your reputation. I brought you new friends, furnished you with a",0.67,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10

5745,ADOLPH,themselves be lured into admiring you. I set you to rule me and my,0.67,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5746,ADOLPH,"house. Then I painted my best pictures, glimmering with reds and",0.67,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5747,ADOLPH,"blues on backgrounds of gold, and there was not an exhibition then",0.67,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10

5749,ADOLPH,"Cecilia, and sometimes Mary Stuart--or little Karin, whom King",0.67,0.4,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5750,ADOLPH,Eric loved. And I turned public attention in your direction. I,0.67,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5751,ADOLPH,compelled the clamorous herd to see yon with my own infatuated,0.67,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5752,ADOLPH,"vision. I plagued them with your personality, forced you literally",0.67,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5753,ADOLPH,"down their throats, until that sympathy which makes everything",0.67,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5754,ADOLPH,possible became yours at last--and you could stand on your own,0.67,0.4,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5755,ADOLPH,"feet. When you reached that far, then my strength was used up, and",0.67,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5756,ADOLPH,"I collapsed from the overstrain--in lifting you up, I had pushed",0.67,0.4,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5757,ADOLPH,"myself down. I was taken ill, and my illness seemed an annoyance",0.67,0.3,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5758,ADOLPH,to you at the moment when all life had just begun to smile at you--,0.67,0.4,0.17,0.2,P,3/10
5759,ADOLPH,"and sometimes it seemed to me as if, in your heart, there was a",0.67,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5760,ADOLPH,secret desire to get rid of your creditor and the witness of your,0.67,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5761,ADOLPH,"rise. Your love began to change into that of a grown-up sister,",0.67,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5762,ADOLPH,and for lack of better I accustomed myself to the new part of,0.67,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5763,ADOLPH,"little brother. Your tenderness for me remained, and even",0.67,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5764,ADOLPH,"increased, but it was mingled with a suggestion of pity that had",0.67,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5765,ADOLPH,in it a good deal of contempt. And this changed into open scorn as,0.67,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5766,ADOLPH,my talent withered and your own sun rose higher. But in some,0.67,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5767,ADOLPH,mysterious way the fountainhead of your inspiration seemed to dry,0.67,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5768,ADOLPH,up when I could no longer replenish it--or rather when you wanted,0.67,0.4,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5769,ADOLPH,to show its independence of me. And at last both of us began to,0.67,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5770,ADOLPH,lose ground. And then you looked for somebody to put the blame on.,0.67,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5771,ADOLPH,"A new victim! For you are weak, and you can never carry your own",0.67,0.45,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5772,ADOLPH,burdens of guilt and debt. And so you picked me for a scapegoat,0.67,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5773,ADOLPH,"and doomed me to slaughter. But when you cut my thews, you didn't",0.67,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5774,ADOLPH,"realise that you were also crippling yourself, for by this time",0.67,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5775,ADOLPH,our years of common life had made twins of us. You were a shoot,0.77,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,2/10
5776,ADOLPH,"sprung from my stem, and you wanted to cut yourself loose before",0.67,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5777,ADOLPH,"the shoot had put out roots of its own, and that's why you",0.67,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5778,ADOLPH,couldn't grow by yourself. And my stem could not spare its main,0.67,0.3,0.16,0.2,P,3/10
5779,ADOLPH,branch--and so stem and branch must die together.,0.67,0.4,0.16,0.2,P,3/10

6471,MR,"if there ought to be another kind of face on top of it, a face",0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6472,MR,quite different in type from yours. And your ears come so close,0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6473,MR,together behind that sometimes I wonder what race you belong to.,0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10

6479,MR,with whom I have become so intimate in this short time--that yon,0.75,0.4,0.06,0.2,P,2/10

6481,MR,"them. When you are not here, and I happen to think of you, I",0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10

6490,MR,anybody or being jostled himself. And from his customary place,0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6491,MR,down by the door he seemed perfectly able to reach whatever he,0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6492,MR,wanted on a table that stood some six feet away from him. He,0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6493,MR,seemed always happy just to be in company. But when he met anybody,0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6494,MR,"he knew, then the joy of it made him roar with laughter, and he",0.85,0.3,0.06,0.2,PLP,1/10
6495,MR,would hug and pat the other fellow as if he hadn't seen a human,0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10

6497,MR,eager to apologise for being in the way. For two years I watched,0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6498,MR,him and amused myself by guessing at his occupation and character.,0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6499,MR,"But I never asked who he was; I didn't want to know, you see, for",0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6500,MR,then all the fun would have been spoiled at once. That man had,0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6501,MR,just your quality of being indefinite. At different times I made,0.85,0.3,0.06,0.2,PLP,1/10

6505,MR,front of him never quite fitted the back. One day I happened to,0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6506,MR,read in a newspaper about a big forgery committed by a well-known,0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6507,MR,government official. Then I learned that my indefinite gentleman,0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6508,MR,"had been a partner of the forger's brother, and that his name was",0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6509,MR,Strawman. Later on I learned that the aforesaid Strawman used to,0.75,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6510,MR,"run a circulating library, but that he was now the police reporter",0.76,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6511,MR,of a big daily. How in the world could I hope to establish a,0.76,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6512,MR,"connection between the forgery, the police, and my little man's",0.76,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6513,MR,peculiar manners? It was beyond me; and when I asked a friend,0.76,0.5,0.06,0.2,P,2/10
6514,MR,"whether Strawman had ever been punished for something, my friend",0.76,0.3,0.06,0.2,P,2/10

6523,MR,"X. No, I didn't want to. [Pause.]",0.76,0.3,0.05,0.2,P,2/10
6524,MR,Y. Would you have been willing to make his acquaintance if he,0.76,0.3,0.05,0.2,P,2/10
6525,MR,had been--punished?,0.76,0.6,0.05,0.2,P,2/10

6527,MR,X. Sit still! Why can't you sit still?,0.76,0.65,0.05,0.2,P,2/10
6528,MR,Y. How did you get your liberal view of human conditions? Are,0.76,0.5,0.05,0.2,P,2/10

6552,MR,X.--any longer! This is the fifth time you have refused to,0.76,0.55,0.05,0.2,P,2/10
6553,MR,write your own name. The first time nothing more serious was,0.76,0.3,0.05,0.2,P,2/10
6554,MR,involved than the receipt for a registered letter. Then I began to,0.76,0.3,0.05,0.2,P,2/10
6555,MR,watch you. And since then I have noticed that you have a morbid,0.76,0.3,0.05,0.2,P,2/10
6556,MR,fear of a pen filled with ink. You have not written a single,0.76,0.3,0.05,0.2,P,2/10
6557,MR,"letter since you came here--only a post-card, and that you wrote",0.76,0.4,0.05,0.2,P,2/10
6558,MR,with a blue pencil. You understand now that I have figured out the,0.76,0.3,0.05,0.2,P,2/10
6559,MR,exact nature of your slip? Furthermore! This is something like the,0.76,0.65,0.05,0.2,P,2/10

6627,MR,"thought of the consequences, of the risk involved, had disappeared—",0.77,0.3,0.04,0.2,P,2/10
6628,MR,no hesitation remained--it was almost as if I was fulfilling,0.77,0.4,0.04,0.2,P,2/10
6629,MR,some sacred duty--and so I wrote! [Leaps to his feet] What could,0.77,0.55,0.04,0.2,P,2/10

6631,MR,"suggestion, as they call it? But from whom could it come? I",0.77,0.7,0.04,0.2,P,2/10
6632,MR,was sleeping alone in that room. Could it possibly be my primitive,0.77,0.3,0.04,0.2,P,2/10
6633,MR,self--the savage to whom the keeping of faith is an unknown thing--,0.77,0.5,0.04,0.2,P,2/10

6637,MR,it?,0.77,0.5,0.04,0.2,P,2/10

6639,MR,"speaking, your story does not convince me--there are gaps in it,",0.77,0.4,0.04,0.2,P,2/10
6640,MR,but these may depend on your failure to recall all the details--,0.77,0.4,0.04,0.2,P,2/10
6641,MR,and I have read something about criminal suggestion--or I think I,0.77,0.4,0.04,0.2,P,2/10
6642,MR,"have, at least--hm! But all that is neither here nor there! You",0.77,0.7,0.04,0.2,P,2/10
6643,MR,have taken your medicine--and you have had the courage to,0.77,0.4,0.04,0.2,P,2/10
6644,MR,acknowledge your fault. Now we won't talk of it any more.,0.77,0.3,0.04,0.2,P,2/10

6648,MR,"Y. No, I am not!",0.77,0.45,0.04,0.2,P,2/10
6649,MR,"X. That's just what bothers me, I tell you. It's exactly what",0.77,0.3,0.04,0.2,P,2/10

6653,MR,"persons who remain children all their lives, so that they cannot",0.77,0.3,0.04,0.2,P,2/10

6655,MR,there you have your criminal.--But I cannot understand why you,0.77,0.4,0.04,0.2,P,2/10
6656,MR,"don't feel innocent. If the child is not held responsible, why",0.77,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6657,MR,should the criminal be regarded differently? It is the more,0.77,0.5,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6658,MR,"strange because--well, perhaps I may come to repent it later.",0.77,0.4,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6659,MR,suffered any qualms on account of it.,0.77,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6660,MR,Y. [Very much interested] Have--you?,0.77,0.6,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6661,MR,"X, Yes, I, and none else! Perhaps you don't care to shake",0.77,0.45,0.03,0.2,P,2/10

6666,ME,much the better for you!--How did you get out of it?,0.77,0.75,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6667,MR,"X. There was nobody to accuse me, no suspicions, no witnesses.",0.77,0.3,0.03,0.7,P,2/10
6668,MR,This is the way it happened. One Christmas I was invited to hunt,0.77,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6669,MR,with a fellow-student a little way out of Upsala. He sent a,0.77,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10

6672,MR,the whole _equipage_ in a ditch. I am not going to pretend that my,0.77,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6673,MR,life was in danger. It was sheer impatience which made me hit him,0.87,0.3,0.03,0.2,PLP,1/10
6674,MR,across the neck with the edge of my hand--you know the way--just,0.77,0.5,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6675,MR,"to wake him up--and the result was that he never woke up at all,",0.77,0.4,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6676,MR,but collapsed then and there.,0.77,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6677,MR,Y. [Craftily] And did you report it?,0.77,0.5,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6678,MR,"X. No, and these were my reasons for not doing so. The man",0.77,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6679,MR,"left no family behind him, or anybody else to whom his life could",0.77,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6680,MR,be of the slightest use. He had already outlived his allotted,0.77,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6681,MR,"period of vegetation, and his place might just as well be filled",0.77,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6682,MR,"by somebody more in need of it. On the other hand, my life was",0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6683,MR,"necessary to the happiness of my parents and myself, and perhaps",0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6684,MR,also to the progress of my science. The outcome had once for all,0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6685,MR,"cured me of any desire to wake up people in that manner, and I",0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6686,MR,didn't care to spoil both my own life and that of my parents for,0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6687,MR,the sake of an abstract principle of justice.,0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10

6693,MR,the fatal outcome in this particular case was simply caused by my,0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6694,MR,ignorance of the effect such a blow might have on an elderly,0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10

6697,MR,punished with a two-year term at hard labour--which is exactly,0.78,0.4,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6698,MR,what one gets for--writing names.,0.78,0.4,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6699,MR,"X. Oh, you may be sure I have thought of it. And more than one",0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6700,MR,night I have dreamt myself in prison. Tell me now--is it really as,0.78,0.4,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6701,MR,bad as they say to find oneself behind bolt and bar?,0.78,0.5,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6702,MR,Y. You bet it is!--First of all they disfigure you by cutting,0.78,0.55,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6703,MR,"off your hair, and if you don't look like a criminal before, you",0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6704,MR,are sure to do so afterward. And when you catch sight of yourself,0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6705,MR,in a mirror you feel quite sure that you are a regular bandit.,0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6706,MR,"X. Isn't it a mask that is being torn off, perhaps? Which",0.78,0.5,0.03,0.2,P,2/10

6708,MR,"Y. Yes, you can have your little jest about it!--And then they",0.78,0.55,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6709,MR,"cut down your food, so that every day and every hour you become",0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6710,MR,conscious of the border line between life and death. Every vital,0.88,0.3,0.03,0.2,PLP,1/10
6711,MR,function is more or less checked. You can feel yourself shrinking.,0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6712,MR,"And your soul, which was to be cured and improved, is instead put",0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6713,MR,on a starvation diet--pushed back a thousand years into outlived,0.78,0.4,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6714,MR,ages. You are not permitted to read anything but what was written,0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6715,MR,for the savages who took part in the migration of the peoples. You,0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6716,MR,hear of nothing but what will never happen in heaven; and what,0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6717,MR,actually does happen on the earth is kept hidden from you. You are,0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6718,MR,"torn out of your surroundings, reduced from your own class, put",0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10

6720,MR,sense of living in the bronze age. You come to feel as if you were,0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6721,MR,"dressed in skins, as if you were living in a cave and eating out",0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6722,MR,of a trough--ugh!,0.78,0.55,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6723,MR,X. But there is reason back of all that. One who acts as if he,0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10
6724,MR,belonged to the bronze age might surely be expected to don the,0.78,0.3,0.03,0.2,P,2/10

6729,MR,"X. [Sharply, watching him closely] What do you mean with that",0.78,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6730,MR,last expression--the golden age?,0.78,0.6,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6731,MR,Y. [With a poorly suppressed snarl] Nothing at all.,0.78,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6732,MR,X. Now you lie--because you are too much of a coward to say,0.78,0.4,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6733,MR,all you think.,0.78,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6734,MR,Y. Am I a coward? You think so? But I was no coward when I,0.78,0.7,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6735,MR,"dared to show myself around here, where I had had to suffer as I",0.78,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6736,MR,did.--But can you tell what makes one suffer most while in there?--,0.78,0.7,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6737,MR,It is that the others are not in there too!,0.78,0.45,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6738,MR,X. What others?,0.78,0.5,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6739,MR,Y. Those that go unpunished.,0.78,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6740,MR,X. Are you thinking of me?,0.78,0.5,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6741,MR,Y. I am.,0.78,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6742,MR,X. But I have committed no crime.,0.78,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6743,MR,"Y. Oh, haven't you?",0.78,0.5,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6744,MR,"X. No, a misfortune is no crime.",0.78,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6745,MR,"Y. So, it's a misfortune to commit murder?",0.88,0.5,0.02,0.2,PLP,1/10
6746,MR,X. I have not committed murder.,0.88,0.3,0.02,0.2,PLP,1/10
6747,MR,Y. Is it not murder to kill a person?,0.98,0.5,0.02,0.2,PLP,0/10
6748,MR,"X. Not always. The law speaks of murder, manslaughter, killing",0.98,0.3,0.02,0.2,PLP,0/10
6749,MR,in self-defence--and it makes a distinction between intentional,0.78,0.4,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6750,MR,"and unintentional killing. However--now you really frighten me,",0.88,0.4,0.02,0.2,PLP,1/10
6751,MR,for it's becoming plain to me that you belong to the most,0.78,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6752,MR,dangerous of all human groups--that of the stupid.,0.78,0.4,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6753,MR,"Y. So you imagine that I am stupid? Well, listen--would you",0.78,0.6,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6754,MR,like me to show you how clever I am?,0.78,0.5,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6755,MR,X. Come on!,0.78,0.45,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6756,MR,Y. I think you'll have to admit that there is both logic and,0.78,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6757,MR,wisdom in the argument I'm now going to give you. You have,0.78,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6758,MR,suffered a misfortune which might have brought you two years at,0.78,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6759,MR,hard labor. You have completely escaped the disgrace of being,0.78,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6760,MR,punished. And here you see before you a man--who has also suffered,0.78,0.4,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6761,MR,a misfortune--the victim of an unconscious impulse--and who has,0.78,0.5,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6762,MR,had to stand two years of hard labor for it. Only by some great,0.78,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6763,MR,scientific achievement can this man wipe off the taint that has,0.78,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6764,MR,become attached to him without any fault of his own--but in order,0.78,0.4,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6765,MR,"to arrive at some such achievement, he must have money--a lot of",0.78,0.4,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6766,MR,"money--and money this minute! Don't you think that the other one,",0.78,0.55,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6767,MR,"the unpunished one, would bring a little better balance into these",0.78,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6768,MR,unequal human conditions if he paid a penalty in the form of a,0.79,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6769,MR,fine? Don't you think so?,0.79,0.7,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6770,MR,X. [Calmly] Yes.,0.79,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6771,MR,Y. Then we understand each other.--Hm! [Pause] What do you,0.79,0.55,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6772,MR,think would be reasonable?,0.79,0.5,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6773,MR,X. Reasonable? The minimum fine in such a case is fixed by the,0.79,0.5,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6774,MR,law at fifty crowns. But this whole question is settled by the,0.79,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6775,MR,fact that the dead man left no relatives.,0.79,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6776,MR,Y. Apparently you don't want to understand. Then I'll have to,0.79,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6777,MR,speak plainly: it is to me you must pay that fine.,0.79,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6778,MR,X. I have never heard that forgers have the right to collect,0.79,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6779,MR,"fines imposed for manslaughter. And, besides, there is no",0.79,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10

6781,MR,Y. There isn't? Well--how would I do?,0.79,0.8,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6782,MR,"X. Oh, _now_ we are getting the matter cleared up! How much do",0.79,0.45,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6783,MR,you want for becoming my accomplice?,0.79,0.5,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6784,MR,Y. Six thousand crowns.,0.79,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6785,MR,X. That's too much. And where am I to get them?,0.79,0.5,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6786,MR,"X. No, I don't want to do that. I don't want to become a",0.79,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6787,MR,thief.,0.79,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6788,MR,"Y. Oh, don't put on any airs now! Do you think I'll believe",0.79,0.45,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6789,MR,that you haven't helped yourself out of that box before?,0.79,0.5,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
6790,MR,"X. [As if speaking to himself] Think only, that I could let",0.79,0.3,0.02,0.2,P,2/10
