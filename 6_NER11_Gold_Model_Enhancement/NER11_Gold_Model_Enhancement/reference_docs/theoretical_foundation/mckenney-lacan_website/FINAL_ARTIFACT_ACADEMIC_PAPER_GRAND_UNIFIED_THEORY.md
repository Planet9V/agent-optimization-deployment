## Abstract

We present a rigorous mathematical framework for modeling the interactions between human psychology and digital systems. By integrating **Differential Geometry**, **Algebraic Topology**, **Spectral Analysis**, and **Lacanian Psychoanalysis**, we derive the **McKenney-Lacan Calculus**. This framework provides a bijective mapping between the "Text Space" of human dialogue and the "Music Space" of harmonic analysis, allowing for the real-time scoring, prediction, and modulation of Cyber-Social Health.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional Cyber Security treats the human element as an "Error" to be minimized. We treat it as a **Feature** to be analyzed. The "McKenney-Lacan Theorem" posits that the structure of the Unconscious mirrors the structure of the Network.

## 2. The Geometry of the Psyche (Team Alpha)

We define the **Psychometric Manifold** $\mathcal{M}$ as a 12-dimensional differentiable manifold equipped with a metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$.
$$ ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu $$
Decision-making is modeled as geodesic motion under the influence of environmental curvature (Trauma).

## 3. The Harmonic Isomorphism (Team Beta)

We prove that the Fourier Transform of a log stream is isomorphic to a Musical Score.
$$ \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{L}) \cong \mathcal{M} $$
This allows us to apply **Music Theory** (Harmony, Counterpoint) to **Cyber Defense**.

## 4. Topological Group Dynamics (Team Gamma)

We model the organization as a Simplicial Complex $K$. The resilience of the team is determined by its **Betti Numbers** $\beta_k$.
$$ \beta_1 = 0 \implies \text{No Bureaucratic Loops} $$

---

## 5. Predictive Stochastics (Team Delta)

We use the **Fokker-Planck Equation** to model the time evolution of the system's probability density function $P(x,t)$.
$$ \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} = \mathcal{L}_{FP} P $$
This allows for the calculation of the "Future Cone" of risk.

## 6. Conclusion

The McKenney-Lacan Calculus is not merely a descriptive tool; it is a **Prescriptive** one. By understanding the geometry, topology, and harmony of the Cyber-Social Organism, we can engineer systems that are not just secure, but **Anti-Fragile**.
