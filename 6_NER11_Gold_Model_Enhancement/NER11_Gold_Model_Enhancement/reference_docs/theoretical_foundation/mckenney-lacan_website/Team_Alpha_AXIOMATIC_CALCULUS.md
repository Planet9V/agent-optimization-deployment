## 1. The Axiom of the Manifold

We postulate that the human psyche exists on a **Differentiable Manifold** $\mathcal{M}$.
*   **Dimensions**: 4 (DISC) + 5 (Big 5) + 3 (Lacan) = 12 Dimensions.
*   **Coordinate System**: $x^\mu = (D, I, S, C, O, C, E, A, N, R, S, I)$.

## 2. The Metric Tensor ($g_{\mu\nu}$)

The "Distance" between two states is defined by the Metric Tensor.
$$ ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu $$
*   **Significance**: It is "harder" to move from High D to High S than from High D to High I. The metric encodes this "Psychological Friction."

## 3. The Geodesic Equation (Decision Making)

A user does not choose randomly; they follow the **Path of Least Resistance** (Geodesic).
$$ \frac{d^2 x^\mu}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\nu\lambda} \frac{dx^\nu}{d\tau} \frac{dx^\lambda}{d\tau} = 0 $$
*   **$\Gamma^\mu_{\nu\lambda}$ (Christoffel Symbols)**: The "Forces" of the environment (Culture, Stress).
*   **Prediction**: If we know the curvature ($\Gamma$), we can predict the decision ($x^\mu$).

## 4. The Curvature of Trauma ($R_{\mu\nu}$)

Trauma (The Real) warps the manifold.
*   **Ricci Curvature**: $R_{\mu\nu} \neq 0$.
*   **Effect**: In a high-stress environment (Cyber Attack), the geodesic curves sharply. A rational actor (High C) may suddenly act irrationally (High I) because the *space itself* is curved.

## 5. Conclusion

We have successfully mapped Psychology to Geometry. We can now use **General Relativity** to model **Organizational Behavior**.
