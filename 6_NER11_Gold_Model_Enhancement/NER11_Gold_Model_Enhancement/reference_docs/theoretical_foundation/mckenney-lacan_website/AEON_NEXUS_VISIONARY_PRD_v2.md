## 1. The Manifesto: Beyond the Dashboard

The **AEON Nexus** is not a website. It is a **Cathedral of the Mind**.
It is the place where the abstract mathematics of the **McKenney-Lacan Calculus** become tangible, explorable, and beautiful.

We reject the "Dashboard" aesthetic (flat, 2D, utilitarian).
We embrace the **"Nexus"** aesthetic (spatial, symphonic, emergent).

**The Goal**: To create an interface so intuitive that a user can "feel" the difference between a *Neurotic* team and a *Psychotic* team just by looking at the shape of the graph.

## 2. The Cosmology: The 11 Pillars

The entry point (`/`) is not a landing page. It is a **Cosmology**.
The user floats in a void, surrounded by **11 Massive Constellations**. Each is a portal.

1.  **The Isomorphism (Music)**: A floating staff of light. *Click to enter the Symphonic Score.*
2.  **The Topology (Knot)**: A rotating Borromean Knot. *Click to enter the Knot Lab.*
3.  **The Geometry (Trauma)**: A warping Riemann Surface. *Click to enter the Gravity Well.*
4.  **The Dynamics (Ising)**: A lattice of spinning spins. *Click to enter the Social Physics Sim.*
5.  **The Thresholds (Cascades)**: A waterfall of particles. *Click to enter the Cascade Model.*
6.  **The Criticality (Bifurcation)**: A branching fractal. *Click to enter the Crisis Predictor.*
7.  **The Warning (Slowing)**: A pulsing red quasar. *Click to enter the Early Warning System.*
8.  **The Tensor (Personality)**: A glowing hypercube. *Click to enter the Psychometric Slicer.*
9.  **The Game (Nash)**: A 3D chessboard. *Click to enter the Negotiation Map.*
10. **The Entropy (Thermodynamics)**: A cloud of gas. *Click to enter the Phase Diagram.*
11. **The Teleology (Omega)**: A blinding white light. *Click to enter the Final Synthesis.*

## 3. The Interface: Dual-Mode Cognition

To handle the "Dense Academic Content" alongside the "Amazing Interaction," we introduce **Dual-Mode UI**.

### 3.1 Conductor Mode (The Right Brain)
*   **Focus**: Intuition, Flow, Visualization.
*   **View**: Full-screen 3D Canvas.
*   **Interaction**: Gestural (Drag, Zoom, Scrub).
*   **Audio**: Full Symphonic Sonification (Tone.js).
*   **Text**: Minimal. Tooltips only.

### 3.2 Scholar Mode (The Left Brain)
*   **Focus**: Rigor, Analysis, Reading.
*   **View**: Split-screen. 3D on the left (small), Text on the right (large).
*   **Interaction**: Hyper-linked Zettelkasten.
*   **Content**: The full 65-Volume Corpus.
*   **Feature**: **"Deep Linking"**. Clicking a paragraph in the text *updates* the 3D view to illustrate that specific theorem.

## 4. The Codex: The Library of Babel

We do not hide the 1000+ lines of text. We celebrate them.
The **Library** is a 3D Galaxy where every "Star" is a document.

*   **The Graph**: Documents are linked by citation.
*   **The Reader**: A beautiful, typography-focused reading experience (Inter/Merriweather).
*   **The AI**: An embedded LLM (The Librarian) that can answer questions like: *"Show me where McKenney defines the Trauma Manifold."*

## 5. The Engine: Code as Consciousness

### 5.1 The Cortex (NER11 Gold)
The system is alive. It feeds on real-time data.
*   **Input**: Slack logs, Emails, Transcripts.
*   **Process**: NER11 extracts Entities and Traits.
*   **Output**: The Graph updates live. The "Cosmology" shifts.

### 5.2 The Heart (Tone.js)
The system has a pulse.
*   **Generative Audio**: The "Heartbeat" synth is driven by the $H(t)$ metric.
*   **Arrhythmia**: If the system is stressed, the beat skips. The user *hears* the problem before they see it.

## 6. Conclusion

This PRD represents a quantum leap in ambition.
We are not building a tool for analysts.
We are building a **Telescope for the Soul**.
