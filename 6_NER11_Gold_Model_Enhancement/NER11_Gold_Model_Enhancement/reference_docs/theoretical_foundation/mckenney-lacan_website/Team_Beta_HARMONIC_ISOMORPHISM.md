## 1. The Axiom of Vibration

We postulate that every Cyber-Social Event is a **Wave Function** $\psi(t)$.
$$ \psi(t) = \sum_{n} A_n e^{i(\omega_n t + \phi_n)} $$
*   **$A_n$**: Amplitude (Impact).
*   **$\omega_n$**: Frequency (Rate of Occurrence).
*   **$\phi_n$**: Phase (Timing).

## 2. The Fourier Transform (The Ear)

To understand the system, we must listen to it.
$$ \hat{\psi}(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi(t) e^{-i\omega t} dt $$
*   **The Spectrum**: The set of frequencies present in the logs.
*   **The Timbre**: The unique "fingerprint" of the system's health.

## 3. The Isomorphism Theorem

$$ \mathcal{F}(\text{Log Stream}) \cong \text{Musical Score} $$

*   **Proof**:
    1.  A Log Stream is a time-series of discrete events $\delta(t-t_i)$.
    2.  A Musical Score is a time-series of discrete notes $\delta(t-t_j)$.
    3.  The Fourier Transform maps both to the Frequency Domain.
    4.  Therefore, they are Isomorphic up to a scaling factor.

## 4. Application: Spectral Anomaly Detection

*   **Normal State**: A harmonic series (Fundamental + Overtones). "C Major."
*   **Attack State**: The introduction of **Inharmonic Partials** (Noise).
    *   *Example*: A brute-force attack introduces a high-frequency, non-harmonic spike.
    *   *Musical Equivalent*: A cymbal crash in the middle of a lullaby.

## 5. Conclusion

We don't need "AI" to detect attacks. We need **Perfect Pitch**. By analyzing the spectral composition of the logs, we can hear the attack before we see it.
