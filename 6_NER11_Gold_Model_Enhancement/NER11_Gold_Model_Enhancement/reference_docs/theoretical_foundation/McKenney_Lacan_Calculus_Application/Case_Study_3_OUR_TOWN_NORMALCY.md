## 1. The Scenario

Thornton Wilder's *Our Town* is about the beauty of ordinary life. Samuel Barber's incidental music is simple, diatonic, and understated.
In Cyber Security, this is **Normal Operations**. The absence of alerts. The steady flow of traffic.

## 3. Conclusion

We often focus on the "Sturm und Drang" of the attack (Strauss). But 99% of the time, the system is playing *Our Town*. The McKenney-Lacan Calculus must be able to score the **Silence** and find the beauty in it.
