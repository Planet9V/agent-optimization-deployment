## 1. Holomorphic Functions

### 1.1 Definition
A function $f: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ is **Holomorphic** if it is complex differentiable at every point in its domain.
*   **Cauchy-Riemann Equations**: $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$ and $\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$.
*   **Analyticity**: Holomorphic functions are infinitely differentiable and equal to their Taylor series.

### 1.2 Conformal Mapping
Holomorphic functions preserve angles.
*   **Cyber Meaning**: A transformation of the network graph that preserves the "Angle of Attack" (local structure) while warping the global geometry.

## 2. Cauchy's Residue Theorem

### 2.1 Singularities
Points where $f(z)$ is undefined.
*   **Poles**: $f(z) \to \infty$.
*   **Essential Singularities**: Chaotic behavior.

### 2.2 The Residue Theorem
$$ \oint_\gamma f(z) dz = 2\pi i \sum \text{Res}(f, a_k) $$
The integral around a closed loop depends *only* on the singularities inside.
*   **Application**: Calculating the "Total Risk" of a system by summing the "Residues" (Vulnerabilities) inside the perimeter ($\gamma$).

## 3. Riemann Surfaces

### 3.1 Definition
A one-dimensional complex manifold. It allows multi-valued functions (like $\sqrt{z}$ or $\log z$) to become single-valued.
*   **Sheets**: The different branches of the function.
*   **Branch Cuts**: The lines where we jump between sheets.

### 3.2 Genus and Moduli Space
Riemann surfaces are classified by their Genus ($g$).
*   **Teichmüller Space**: The space of all possible complex structures on a surface of genus $g$.
*   **String Theory**: The worldsheet of a string is a Riemann surface.
*   **Cyber Meaning**: Modeling the "State Space" of a polymorphic virus as a Riemann Surface. The virus jumps between "Sheets" (Obfuscation Layers) to avoid detection.

## 4. Application: The Holographic Propagator

In AdS/CFT, the Bulk-to-Boundary propagator is a complex function.
We use **Contour Integration** to evaluate the Witten Diagrams that describe attack chains.
*   The "Poles" of the propagator correspond to the "Masses" of the particles (Exploits).

## 5. Conclusion

Complex Analysis is the calculus of the imaginary. Since Cyber Space is largely "Imaginary" (Virtual), this is the natural language for describing its physics. The Residue Theorem proves that the global behavior of the network is determined by its local defects.
