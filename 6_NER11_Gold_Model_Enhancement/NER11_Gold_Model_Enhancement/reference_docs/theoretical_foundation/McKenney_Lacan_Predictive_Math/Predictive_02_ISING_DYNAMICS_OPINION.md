## 1. The Core Equation

$$ \frac{dm}{dt} = -m + \tanh(\beta(Jzm + h)) $$

*   **$m$ (Magnetization)**: The average opinion of the group.
    *   $m = +1$: High Security Awareness (Secure).
    *   $m = -1$: Negligence / Insider Threat (Insecure).

## 2. The Variables

### 2.1 Interaction Strength ($J$)
The strength of peer influence.
*   **Cyber Factors**: Team Cohesion, Slack Activity, Social Proof.
*   **Effect**: If $J$ is high, the group acts as a monolith. If one clicks a link, they all click.

### 2.2 External Field ($h$)
The external force applied to align spins.
*   **Cyber Factors**: Security Awareness Training, CEO Mandates, Phishing Campaigns (Negative $h$).
*   **Effect**: A strong $h$ can force alignment, but if $J$ is high, the group may resist.

### 2.3 Temperature ($T = 1/\beta$)
The level of "Social Noise" or volatility.
*   **Cyber Factors**: Organizational Chaos, Layoffs, High Turnover.
*   **Effect**: High $T$ destroys order ($m \to 0$). Low $T$ "freezes" the culture.

## 3. Application: The Phase Transition

### 3.1 The Critical Temperature ($T_c$)
Below $T_c$, the organization spontaneously magnetizes (forms a strong culture).
Above $T_c$, the culture is random (paramagnetic).

### 3.2 Hysteresis (Memory)
Once a culture is "frozen" in a bad state ($m = -1$), a small positive field ($h > 0$) is not enough to flip it. You need a **Strong Shock** (Crisis) to overcome the hysteresis loop.

## 4. Conclusion

Security Culture is not a linear sum of individuals. It is a **Collective Phenomenon**. The Ising Model allows us to calculate the exact "Field Strength" ($h$) required to flip a toxic department from Negligent to Secure.
