## OpenSPG

https://github.com/openspg


OpenSPG is an open engine for knowledge graph designed and implemented on the basis of SPG framework, which provides explicit semantic representations, logical rule definitions, operator frameworks (construction, inference) and other capabilities for the domain knowledge graphs, and supports pluggable adaptation of basic engines and algorithmic services by various vendors to build customized solutions.

## OpenSPG Core Capabilities:

### SPG-Schema semantic modeling
Schema framework responsible for semantic enhancement of property graphs, such as subject models, evolutionary models, predicate models, etc.

### SPG-Builder knowledge construction
Supports the construction of both structured and unstructured knowledge.
Compatible and articulated with big data architecture, provides a knowledge construction operator framework to realize the conversion from data to knowledge.
Abstracts the knowledge processing SDK framework, provides the ability of entity linking, concept standardization and entity normalization operators, combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning algorithms, improves the uniqueness level of different instances within a single type. Furthermore, it supports the continuous iterative evolution of the domain knowledge graphs.

### SPG-Reasoner logical rule reasoning
Abstracts KGDSL (Knowledge Graph Domain Specific Language) to provide programmable symbolic representation of logic rules.
Supports downstream tasks, such as rule inference, neural/symbolic fusion learning, 

### KG2Prompt 
linked LLM knowledge extraction/knowledge reasoning, represented in machine-understandable symbolic form.
Define dependency and transfer between knowledge through predicate semantics and logic rules, and support modeling and analysis of complex business scenarios.

### Programmable Framework -- KNext
As a programmable framework of knowledge graph, KNext offers a set of extensible, procedural, and user-friendly components;
It abstracts the core capabilities of knowledge graphs, congealing them into componentized, framework-oriented, and engine-built-in capabilities;
Achieves isolation between the engine and business logic, domain models, facilitating rapid definition of knowledge graph solutions for businesses;
Constructs a controllable AI technology stack driven by knowledge, based on the 

### OpenSPG engine, connecting deep learning capabilities such as LLM and GraphLearning.
