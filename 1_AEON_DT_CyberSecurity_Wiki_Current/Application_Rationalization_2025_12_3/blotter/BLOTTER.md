## E01 APT Threat Intelligence Ingestion - Session 2025-12-10

### Session Start: 2025-12-10 20:24:30 UTC

**Objective**: Ingest 25 APT/Malware IoC files using E30 official ingestion pipeline with NER11v3 Gold Model, hierarchical enrichment, and dual storage (Qdrant + Neo4j).

---

### Critical Corrections Applied

#### 1. E30 SOP Violation Fix
**Issue**: Attempted to use regex parsing instead of E30 official pipeline  
**User Feedback**: "why do you keep messing up?"  
**Fix**: 
- Stored `MANDATORY_SOP_E30_INGESTION` in permanent claude-flow memory
- Stored `WORKFLOW_CHECKLIST_BEFORE_ANY_TASK` in permanent memory
- Updated workflow: ALWAYS check memory for existing SOP before implementation

#### 2. NER11 API Endpoint Correction
**Issue**: Pipeline calling `/extract` endpoint (404 Not Found)  
**Root Cause**: Incorrect endpoint in `05_ner11_to_neo4j_hierarchical.py:160`  
**Fix**: Changed `/extract` → `/ner` (line 160)  
**Validation**: Successfully processed 2 documents with 7 entities before API crash

#### 3. Timeout Configuration Increase
**Issue**: NER11 API timeouts on large APT documents (30s insufficient)  
**Fix**: Increased timeout from 30s → 90s (line 162)  
**Agent**: Coder agent (ID: cfd50964)

---

### Infrastructure Validation (2025-12-10 20:24:31)

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| NER11 API v3.3.0 | ✅ HEALTHY | Port 8000, custom + fallback models loaded |
| Qdrant | ✅ OPERATIONAL | Port 6333, 6 collections, 319,623 existing entities |
| Neo4j 5.26 | ✅ OPERATIONAL | Port 7687, 1,150,171 baseline nodes preserved |
| Docker Network | ✅ HEALTHY | aeon-net (172.18.0.0/16) |

### Ingestion Attempt #1 Results (2025-12-10 20:24-20:26)

**Pipeline**: `06_bulk_graph_ingestion.py --max-docs 25 --batch-size 5`

**Outcome**: ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS - API crash after 2 documents

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Documents found | 39 |
| Documents processed | 9 (2 new + 7 previously completed) |
| Documents skipped | 16 (already processed) |
| Entities extracted | 7 |
| Nodes created | 7 |
| Nodes added to Neo4j | 3 (1,150,171 → 1,150,174) |
| Relationships created | 0 |
| Processing time | 1:45 minutes |

**Errors Encountered**:
1. NER11 API timeouts (30s) on 3 large documents
2. Connection reset errors (5 documents)
3. Neo4j syntax error: `CybersecurityKB.AttackTechnique` (illegal '.' in label)

### Current Session State (2025-12-10 20:35:00)

**E01 Completion Status**: 13 APT documents pending (0% complete)

**Blocking Issues Identified**:
1. ✅ RESOLVED: API endpoint `/extract` → `/ner`
2. ✅ RESOLVED: Timeout 30s → 90s
3. ⚠️ PENDING: Neo4j syntax error `CybersecurityKB.AttackTechnique`
4. ⚠️ PENDING: Hierarchical schema not applied to Qdrant
5. ⚠️ PENDING: APT source documents not found in Qdrant

**Next Steps**:
1. Fix Neo4j label syntax issue
2. Verify APT source document paths
3. Re-run E30 ingestion with corrected configuration
4. Monitor relationship creation
5. Validate hierarchical enrichment in both databases

**Memory Stored** (claude-flow):
- `E01_SESSION_PROGRESS` - Session state and issues
- `E30_API_ENDPOINT_FIX` - Endpoint correction details
- `PARALLEL_EXECUTION_STRATEGY` - 5-agent coordination plan
- `KAGGLE_ENRICHMENT_PLAN` - Dataset integration strategy
- `E01_INGESTION_ANALYSIS` - Failure analysis and resume plan
- `QDRANT_VALIDATION_E01` - Entity storage validation

### Session End: 2025-12-10 20:35:00 UTC

**Status**: ⚠️ E01 INCOMPLETE - Requires re-execution with fixes
**Infrastructure**: ✅ All systems operational
**Corrections Applied**: 3 critical fixes (SOP, endpoint, timeout)
**Documentation Created**: 7 comprehensive reports + memory storage
**Parallel Execution**: ✅ 5 agents completed successfully in 9 minutes
