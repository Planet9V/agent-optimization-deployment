# Vendor Security - GE Digital Energy Systems

## Entity-Rich Introduction

General Electric Company (GE Digital, 2623 Camino Ramon, San Ramon, CA 94583) Mark VIe distributed control systems (IS420UCSBH4A Universal Controller with triple-modular redundant processors, 512 MB RAM per module, QNX RTOS 7.1) implement defense-in-depth security architecture with hardware-enforced separation between control processors and communications modules, cryptographic firmware verification using RSA-4096 digital signatures (SHA-384 hash algorithm), and secure boot sequence validating bootloader integrity before initialization. GE Grid Solutions e-terra platform (SCADA/EMS version 3.5.1) integrates Cyber Security Management System (CSMS) following IEC 62351 standards: IEC 62351-3 (TCP/IP security with TLS 1.3), IEC 62351-4 (MMS security with application-level authentication), IEC 62351-6 (IEC 61850 security with role-based access control), and IEC 62351-8 (role-based access control with 64 predefined security roles). iFIX SCADA version 6.5 (Build 6.5.0.0) employs GE Security Authority (GSA) authentication service with Kerberos v5 protocol (RFC 4120), AES-256 encryption for historian data storage (PI Asset Framework integration), and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integration via CEF (Common Event Format) syslog forwarding to Splunk Enterprise Security 7.0.

## Integration & Operations

GE iFIX SCADA security architecture implements multi-layered authentication and authorization: Windows Active Directory integration via LDAP (TCP port 389, StartTLS upgrade to TLS 1.2), GE Security Authority (GSA) policy enforcement defining 32 security areas (SA-001 through SA-032) with granular permissions per HMI screen and data point, and Kerberos v5 ticket-granting for single sign-on across distributed iFIX nodes (6-hour ticket lifetime, renewable once). iFIX historian data protection uses PI System AF Server 2021 with encrypted storage (AES-256-XTS at-rest encryption, SQL Server 2019 TDE enabled) and secure queries via PI Web API 2021 (OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens, JWT with 1-hour expiration, refresh tokens stored in HSM-backed key vault). Mark VIe control system integration follows defense-in-depth model: Level 0 turbine sensors (RTD temperature sensors, vibration probes, pressure transducers) connect to I/O modules (IS200TBAIH2C analog input terminal boards) via shielded cables with galvanic isolation (2500V isolation voltage), Level 1 UCMP controller modules (IS420UCSBH4A) execute control logic in deterministic QNX RTOS with 10ms scan cycle, Level 2 HMI workstations (WorkstationST version 7.0) connect via dedicated control network (192.168.10.0/24, VLAN 100) with no routing to enterprise, and Level 3 engineering access requires physical connection to diagnostic network (192.168.11.0/24, VLAN 110) isolated from control network.

e-terra SCADA/EMS platform security enforces IEC 62351 protocol security profiles: DNP3 Secure Authentication (DNP3-SAv5 per IEEE 1815-2012) with HMAC-SHA256 message authentication, symmetric session keys rotated every 8 hours, and challenge-response authentication preventing replay attacks; IEC 61850 MMS over TLS (RFC 6983 mapping) with mutual authentication using X.509 certificates (2048-bit RSA, issued by GE Grid Solutions internal CA), cipher suite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, and perfect forward secrecy. e-terra Web HMI (HTML5 client version 3.5.1) implements secure web application patterns: Content Security Policy (CSP) headers blocking inline scripts, HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) enforcing HTTPS with 1-year max-age, secure cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict flags), and Web Application Firewall (ModSecurity 3.0.6 with OWASP Core Rule Set 3.3.2) protecting against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Security monitoring aggregates events from: iFIX Alarm Service (50,000 alarms/day average), Mark VIe diagnostic logs (1 GB/day per turbine), e-terra audit database (PostgreSQL 14.5 with row-level security), and network flow data (NetFlow v9 from Cisco IE-4000 switches, 500,000 flows/hour) into centralized SIEM (Splunk Enterprise Security 7.0 with GE Energy Add-on v2.1 parsing proprietary log formats).

## Security Implementation

Vulnerability management follows GE PSIRT (Product Security Incident Response Team) coordinated disclosure process with CVE tracking: CVE-2021-27417 (iFIX SCADA remote code execution via malformed tag, CVSS 9.8, patched in iFIX 6.5 Patch 003), CVE-2020-12020 (Mark VIe diagnostic interface authentication bypass, CVSS 8.1, patched in firmware R07.06.03), CVE-2019-18233 (e-terra SQL injection in reporting module, CVSS 7.5, patched in version 3.4.2). Patch deployment follows staged process: (1) Security Advisory released via GE Digital portal with affected versions, workarounds, and patch availability; (2) Customer notification via email within 24 hours of critical vulnerabilities (CVSS ≥9.0); (3) Patch validation in test environment (minimum 2-week testing period for control systems, 1 week for SCADA); (4) Maintenance window scheduling coordinated with operations (scheduled during planned turbine outages, average 2-4 week advance notice); (5) Patch application via ToolboxST version 7.0 for Mark VIe controllers or iFIX Patch Installer for SCADA systems; (6) Post-patch verification including regression testing of critical control functions and security validation scans.

Network architecture security implements GE recommended reference architecture (GE-RA-001 Rev C): (1) Air-gapped control network (Mark VIe controllers on 192.168.10.0/24, no physical connection to enterprise), (2) DMZ for data historians (PI System interface nodes on 10.50.100.0/24) with unidirectional gateways (Owl Cyber Defense DualDiode technology, hardware-enforced one-way data flow) replicating process data from control network to enterprise historians, (3) Secure remote access via GE Remote Access Gateway (GE-RAG-100 appliance) implementing: VPN termination (IPsec IKEv2 with AES-256-GCM), multi-factor authentication (RSA SecurID integration), session recording (all GE support sessions recorded to tamper-proof storage), and privileged access management (break-glass accounts with approval workflow). Industrial firewall policies (Palo Alto PA-5220 with GE-provided security profiles) enforce: Mark VIe EGD protocol (UDP 18246) restricted to controller-to-controller communication only, Modbus/TCP (port 502) blocked except from authorized HMI systems, all TCP/UDP high ports (>1024) denied except explicitly approved applications (ToolboxST engineering access on TCP 5555, syslog forwarding on TCP 6514).

Compliance framework addresses NERC CIP requirements with pre-configured security templates: CIP-005-6 Electronic Security Perimeter (ESP) documentation template includes network diagrams showing External Routable Connectivity (ERC) points, Electronic Access Points (EAPs) with associated firewall rules, and Interactive Remote Access (IRA) controls; CIP-007-6 Systems Security Management baseline configurations for iFIX SCADA servers (Windows Server 2019 hardened per CIS Benchmark Level 2, unnecessary services disabled, security event logging enabled with 90-day retention); CIP-010-4 Configuration Change Management and Vulnerability Assessments with baseline configurations stored in version control (Git repository), quarterly vulnerability scanning using Tenable Nessus (Industrial Security plugin feed 202310151), and annual penetration testing performed by GE Grid Solutions Security Services.
