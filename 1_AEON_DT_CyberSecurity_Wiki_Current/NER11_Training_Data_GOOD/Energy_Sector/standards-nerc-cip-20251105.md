# NERC CIP Cybersecurity Standards for Electric Utilities

## Standards Overview

NERC CIP-002-5.1a Cyber Security - BES Cyber System Categorization identifies and categorizes bulk electric system cyber systems based on impact to reliable operation. High-impact BES cyber systems include control centers performing real-time operations, generation resources exceeding 1500 MW, and transmission substations at 500 kV and above with switching capability. Medium-impact systems encompass generation between 75 MW and 1500 MW, transmission substations between 200 kV and 499 kV, and control centers operating medium-impact systems. Low-impact systems include distribution providers owning assets contributing to bulk electric system reliability with aggregate generation exceeding 75 MW.

NERC CIP-003-8 Cyber Security - Security Management Controls requires documented cyber security policies approved by senior management addressing personnel training, electronic security perimeters, physical security, incident response planning, disaster recovery, configuration management, vulnerability assessments, and security patch management. Cybersecurity plan documentation identifies responsible individuals, annual review dates, policy enforcement mechanisms, and change management procedures. Low-impact assets implement specific objective criteria including cyber security awareness training, electronic access controls, physical security controls, and incident response for reportable cyber security incidents within 24 hours.

NERC CIP-005-6 Electronic Security Perimeter establishes network boundaries protecting BES cyber systems through firewall rules, intrusion detection systems, and network access controls. External routable connectivity requires intermediate systems preventing direct connectivity between external networks and protected cyber assets. Remote access employs multi-factor authentication combining passwords, tokens, or biometrics with encrypted communication channels using TLS 1.2 or IPsec VPN tunnels. Dial-up access requires disconnect or disable when not actively used with authentication before establishing connection and logging all access attempts.

NERC CIP-007-6 System Security Management implements technical controls including port and service management, security patch management, malware prevention, security event monitoring, and system access controls. Ports and services enables only essential ports with documented justification for all enabled services reviewed annually. Security patches evaluate within 35 calendar days of release and install patches remediating critical or high vulnerabilities within 35 days of evaluation or document mitigating measures. Malware prevention tools employ signature-based and behavior-based detection updating definitions within 35 days of release.

## Technical Requirements

CIP-010-3 Configuration Change Management and Vulnerability Assessments requires baseline configurations documenting operating system versions, patch levels, installed software, enabled services, network addresses, security patches, and antivirus definitions. Change management processes authorize configuration changes before implementation, document changes including security implications, and verify security controls remain effective after changes. Vulnerability assessments employ authenticated scanning every 15 calendar months identifying system weaknesses with remediation or mitigation within timeframes based on severity ratings. Transient cyber assets connecting to BES cyber systems require malware scanning before connection and patch currency verification within 35 days.

CIP-011-2 Information Protection protects BES cyber system information from unauthorized disclosure including network topology, security configurations, physical security diagrams, and access credentials. Information classification procedures identify information requiring protection with storage encryption, transmission encryption, and access controls restricting viewing to authorized personnel. Reuse and disposal methods sanitize media containing protected information using NIST SP 800-88 guidelines before redeployment or destruction. Cloud service providers protecting BES cyber system information must implement equivalent security controls with contractual obligations documenting security responsibilities.

## Compliance Obligations

CIP-013-1 Supply Chain Risk Management develops plans addressing cybersecurity risks from vendors, system integrators, and service providers. Procurement language includes security requirements for hardware, software, and services with vendor notification obligations for security vulnerabilities discovered during product lifecycle. Vendor risk assessments evaluate security capabilities, incident response procedures, and information protection practices before contract award. Ongoing monitoring reviews vendor security posture annually with reassessment triggered by significant security incidents or control deficiencies.

CIP-014-2 Physical Security requires physical security plans protecting transmission stations and substations critical to bulk electric system reliability. Risk assessments identify critical facilities evaluating potential threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences of physical attacks. Physical security measures implement monitored access controls, surveillance systems, intrusion alarms, and security personnel with quarterly verification of system effectiveness. Law enforcement coordination establishes communication protocols, shares threat intelligence, and conducts joint exercises annually maintaining response readiness.

## Audit Processes

Compliance monitoring employs self-certifications submitted triennially, spot checks conducted as needed, compliance investigations following alleged violations, and periodic data submissions providing operational metrics. Evidence retention maintains documentation and records for 3 calendar years or until conclusion of enforcement action demonstrating standard compliance. Violation severity levels range from lower risk requiring minimal obligation to severe risk threatening bulk electric system reliability with corresponding penalty structures. Mitigation plans address standard violations with corrective actions, completion milestones, and preventive measures avoiding recurrence.

Self-reporting obligations require entities to submit compliance exception notifications within 24 hours of discovering possible violations with detailed descriptions. Evidence preservation prevents destruction of compliance data when violation suspected until enforcement process concludes. Technical feasibility exceptions allow temporary non-compliance with approved mitigation plans and completion deadlines. Compliance registry identifies entities subject to reliability standards based on functional registrations including transmission operators, balancing authorities, generation owners, and distribution providers.

## Integration Architecture

SCADA network segmentation isolates control system networks from corporate IT using unidirectional security gateways, firewalls with deny-by-default rules, and demilitarized zones hosting data historians. IEC 62351 security integration implements authenticated GOOSE messages, encrypted MMS communication, and role-based access control for IEC 61850 substations. Security information and event management SIEM systems collect logs from firewalls, intrusion detection systems, authentication servers, and cyber assets correlating events identifying security incidents. Continuous monitoring employs network traffic analysis detecting anomalous communication patterns, unauthorized devices, and protocol violations indicating potential cyber attacks.

Vulnerability management programs scan control systems quarterly using authenticated credentialed scanning identifying operating system vulnerabilities, missing security patches, weak passwords, and insecure configurations. Penetration testing simulates adversary techniques attempting unauthorized access, lateral movement, and data exfiltration validating security control effectiveness. Industrial control system cybersecurity training provides role-based instruction covering ICS architecture, common attack vectors, defensive strategies, and incident response procedures. Incident response plans define cyber security incident definitions, escalation procedures, forensic evidence collection, system recovery processes, and regulatory reporting obligations with annual drill exercises.
