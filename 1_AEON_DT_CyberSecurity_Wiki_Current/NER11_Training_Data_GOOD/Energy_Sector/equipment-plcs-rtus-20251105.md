ABB RTU560 remote terminal unit operates on Linux platform with IEC 61850 server, DNP3 outstation, and Modbus slave protocol stacks. Siemens SICAM RTU delivers power system automation with telecontrol protocols including IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104, and DNP3 over TCP/IP.

Programmable logic controllers include Rockwell Automation ControlLogix 1756-L85E with 10 MB user memory and 1 GB non-volatile storage executing ladder logic at 20 microseconds per thousand instructions. Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500F fail-safe controller provides SIL3-rated safety functions with PROFIsafe communication protocol for safety-critical power plant applications. Schneider Electric Modicon M580 ePAC delivers 12 MB application memory with hot-standby redundancy achieving bumpless transfer during controller switchover. Emerson PACSystems RX3i combines Intel Celeron processor with QNX real-time operating system for deterministic control execution.

Distribution automation controllers include Cooper Power Systems Form 6 Vault-N-Pole Control with integrated recloser control, capacitor bank switching, and voltage regulator management. SEL-651R-2 recloser control relay provides three-phase overcurrent protection with automatic sectionalizing following permanent fault detection. Eaton Cooper VR-32 voltage regulator control maintains distribution voltage within ±2% bandwidth through 32-step tap changing mechanism. S&C Electric IntelliRupter PulseCloser fault interrupter operates at 27 kV with vacuum interrupter technology and integrated RTU controller.

Substation automation IEDs include ABB REF630 feeder protection and control device with trip circuit supervision, breaker failure protection, and synchrocheck elements. Siemens SIPROTEC 7SJ85 overcurrent relay provides directional ground fault detection with cold load pickup and reclosing supervision. GE Multilin B90 bus protection relay implements high-impedance differential protection with restraint characteristics preventing CT saturation errors. Schneider Electric Sepam 80 series combines protection, control, and monitoring functions with Modbus RTU and IEC 61850 communication.

## Technical Specifications

RTU input/output modules include digital input cards with wet contact sensing at 48/125 VDC detecting state changes within 2 milliseconds. Analog input modules provide 16-bit resolution measuring 0-10 VDC or 4-20 mA signals with 0.1% accuracy class. Digital output modules deliver form-C relay contacts rated 10 A at 250 VAC or solid-state outputs switching 2 A at 48 VDC. Analog output modules generate 4-20 mA signals driving valve positioners or speed controllers with 12-bit resolution.

Communication interfaces support RS-232/RS-485 serial ports operating at baud rates from 300 to 115,200 bps with RTU or ASCII framing. Ethernet ports provide 10/100 Mbps copper connectivity with RJ45 connectors or 100 Mbps fiber with LC connectors supporting single-mode or multimode cable. GPS clock inputs synchronize controller timestamps to UTC time using IRIG-B, IEEE 1588 PTP, or NTP protocols. Cellular modems enable remote access through 4G LTE networks with APN configuration and VPN tunneling capabilities.

## Operational Characteristics

SCADA polling cycles execute at configurable intervals from one second to several minutes with exception-based reporting transmitting updates only when values change beyond deadband thresholds. DNP3 Class 0 polls retrieve static data including current measurements while Class 1-3 polls obtain time-tagged events from RTU buffers. IEC 60870-5-104 spontaneous transmission sends information objects immediately upon change detection with sequence numbering preventing duplicate processing. Modbus master-slave communication uses function code 01 for coil reads, function code 03 for holding registers, and function code 16 for multi-register writes.

Fault recording capabilities capture waveforms at 128 samples per cycle with pre-trigger and post-trigger recording windows totaling 10 seconds duration. Event logs store 10,000 timestamped entries including protection operations, communication failures, and configuration changes. Battery backup systems provide eight hours autonomous operation during AC power loss using sealed lead-acid batteries at 48 VDC. Environmental hardening enables operation from -40°C to +85°C ambient temperature with conformal coating protecting circuit boards from moisture.

## Integration Architecture

Multi-drop serial networks connect multiple RTUs using RS-485 with automatic baud rate detection and termination resistors at network endpoints. Ethernet/IP industrial protocol provides producer-consumer communication model with implicit messaging reducing network traffic by 40% compared to polled architectures. Distributed Network Protocol 3.0 implements secure authentication using HMAC-SHA256 algorithms and challenge-response mechanisms preventing replay attacks. OPC UA client-server architecture exposes RTU data through information model enabling enterprise system integration with role-based access control.

Redundant communication paths employ primary MPLS circuits with 4G LTE backup automatically failing over within 30 seconds detecting communication loss. Virtual private networks tunnel through public internet using IPsec encryption with AES-256 ciphers and certificate-based authentication. Network address translation enables private IP addressing schemes in substations while connecting to centralized SCADA systems through NAT gateways. Quality of service tagging prioritizes protection GOOSE messages with DSCP values ensuring millisecond-level delivery during network congestion.
