# Security Architecture - Energy Sector

## Entity-Rich Introduction

Palo Alto Networks PA-5220 next-generation firewalls (PA-5220-AC with 20 Gbps throughput, 8 GB RAM, PAN-OS 10.2.3) implement IEC 62443-3-3 security level SL 3 zoning between operational technology networks (VLAN 100, 192.168.100.0/24) and enterprise systems (VLAN 10, 10.50.0.0/16). Cisco Industrial Ethernet 4000 Series switches (IE-4000-16T4G-E with 16 Gigabit ports, IE-4000-8GT4G-E for edge networks) enforce NERC CIP-005-6 Electronic Security Perimeter (ESP) controls with deep packet inspection of DNP3 Secure Authentication v5 (IEEE 1815-2012), IEC 61850 MMS/GOOSE messaging (IEC 61850-8-1 edition 2.1), and Modbus TCP traffic (TCP port 502). Fortinet FortiGate 200F firewalls (FG-200F with 10 Gbps threat protection, 4 GB RAM, FortiOS 7.0.5) provide defense-in-depth at demilitarized zones (DMZ) between Level 2 control networks and Level 3 supervisory systems, implementing TLS 1.3 (RFC 8446) inspection, IPsec VPN (AES-256-GCM encryption), and intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures 50000-55000 targeting energy sector SCADA protocols.

## Integration & Operations

IEC 62443-3-3 security architecture implements five distinct security zones aligned with ISA-95/Purdue Model: Level 0 Field Devices (VLAN 100, 192.168.100.0/24) contains 500+ field instruments (Rosemount 3051S pressure transmitters, Endress+Hauser Promag 10P electromagnetic flowmeters) communicating via HART-IP (UDP port 5094) and Foundation Fieldbus H1 (31.25 kbit/s), isolated by Cisco IE-4000-8GT4G-E switches with port security limiting MAC addresses to 2 per port. Level 1 Control (VLAN 200, 192.168.200.0/24) hosts Siemens SIMATIC S7-1518-4 PN/DP PLCs, GE Mark VIe turbine controllers, and ABB Symphony Plus distributed control systems, with Palo Alto PA-3220 firewalls (8 Gbps throughput, PAN-OS 10.2.3) enforcing stateful inspection of PROFINET IRT (100 Mbps, 1 ms cycle time), Modbus TCP function codes 0x01-0x06, and DNP3 Secure Authentication using custom App-ID signatures PROF-001 through PROF-050. Level 2 Supervisory (VLAN 300, 192.168.300.0/24) contains Schneider Electric EcoStruxure Control Expert SCADA servers, OSIsoft PI System historians (AF Server 2021, Data Archive 2021 SP1), and GE Digital iFIX 6.5 HMI stations, protected by Fortinet FortiGate 200F with IPS signatures 50123 (DNP3 function code anomaly), 50456 (IEC 61850 MMS overflow), 50789 (Modbus TCP malformed packet). DMZ zone (VLAN 400, 10.50.100.0/24) implements unidirectional security gateways (Waterfall Security Unidirectional Gateway UG-3000) for data historian replication to enterprise, allowing OSIsoft PI-to-PI replication while physically preventing reverse traffic. Level 3/4 Enterprise (VLAN 10, 10.50.0.0/16) connects to SAP S/4HANA manufacturing execution system via application proxy (F5 BIG-IP APM 16.1.0) with SSL/TLS termination, certificate validation against Microsoft AD CS PKI, and OAuth 2.0 token validation.

NERC CIP compliance enforcement includes CIP-005-6 (Electronic Security Perimeters) with PA-5220 firewalls logging all denied traffic to Splunk SIEM (average 50,000 events/day, retention 7 years per FERC Order 791), CIP-007-6 (Systems Security Management) with Cisco ISE 3.1 performing 802.1X authentication of all Level 1-2 devices using EAP-TLS with X.509 certificates, and CIP-011-2 (Information Protection) with NetApp AFF A400 encrypted storage arrays (AES-256-XTS at-rest encryption, TLS 1.3 for management). Jump servers (Dell PowerEdge R650 with Windows Server 2022, 64 GB RAM) in secure access zone (VLAN 500, 10.50.200.0/24) require multi-factor authentication (RSA SecurID SID800 hardware tokens, 6-digit TOTP) and session recording (ObserveIT 7.13 capturing all RDP/SSH sessions to immutable storage). Security monitoring aggregates logs from 150+ sources including Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 PLCs (syslog over TLS to Splunk HEC), PA-5220 firewall threat logs (average 5 GB/day), Cisco IE-4000 switch NetFlow v9 (1 million flows/hour), and Dragos Platform 7.0 ICS threat detection generating 20-50 alerts/day with MITRE ATT&CK for ICS technique mapping.

## Security Implementation

Defense-in-depth architecture implements network segmentation with Palo Alto PA-5220 NGFWs enforcing zone-based policies: (1) Level 0↔Level 1 allows only HART-IP UDP/5094 and FF H1 traffic from specific device MACs, blocking all other protocols via App-ID denial rule DENY-L0-L1-001; (2) Level 1↔Level 2 permits PROFINET IRT (EtherType 0x8892), Modbus TCP to specific register ranges (40001-45000 read-only for SCADA), DNP3 SAv5 with HMAC-SHA256 authentication; (3) Level 2↔Level 3 restricted to OPC UA secure channel (TCP 4840-4843, security policy Basic256Sha256, message mode SignAndEncrypt) and HTTPS (TLS 1.3 with ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 cipher) for web HMI access. Intrusion detection deploys Cisco Firepower 2130 NGIPS with Snort 3.0 engine processing 10 Gbps traffic, custom ICS rules detect: DNP3 function code anomalies (rule 3000123), IEC 61850 MMS unauthorized write attempts (rule 3000456), Modbus TCP function code 0x08 diagnostic manipulation (rule 3000789), unauthorized EtherNet/IP CIP connections (rule 3001012), and replay attacks against DNP3 secure authentication (rule 3001234). Compliance verification follows IEC 62443-3-3 foundational requirements: FR 1 (Identification and Authentication Control) via Cisco ISE 802.1X with EAP-TLS certificates, FR 2 (Use Control) via application whitelisting (McAfee Application Control 8.3.3), FR 3 (System Integrity) via file integrity monitoring (Tripwire Enterprise 9.1), FR 4 (Data Confidentiality) via TLS 1.3 encryption for all Level 2-3 communications, FR 5 (Restricted Data Flow) via firewall rules and unidirectional gateways, FR 6 (Timely Response to Events) via SIEM correlation rules with 5-minute alert SLA, FR 7 (Resource Availability) via redundant firewalls (PA-5220 active/active cluster, 100ms failover).
