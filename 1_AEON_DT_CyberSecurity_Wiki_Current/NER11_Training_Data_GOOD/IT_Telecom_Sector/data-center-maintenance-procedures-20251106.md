Baseline measurements show: Cold_Aisle_Row_12_Tile_Position_8 measuring 450 FPM velocity (25% open perforated tile, 750 CFM airflow calculated from 1.67 sq-ft tile area), Tile_Position_12 measuring 380 FPM (same tile type indicating non-uniform distribution). Optimization procedure adjusts damper controls on Smart_Floor_Tile_System (Tate-Intellivent dampered tiles, motorized actuator controlled via BMS providing variable airflow 100-800 CFM per tile) increasing flow to Rack_R12-08 (hotspot identified via DCIM monitoring showing inlet temperature 28°C exceeding 25°C setpoint). Post-adjustment verification shows balanced airflow distribution 420-450 FPM across row with rack inlet temperatures 23-25°C range meeting ASHRAE-TC9.9 thermal guidelines.

**Underfloor Obstruction Removal**: Annual underfloor inspection identifies airflow restrictions degrading cooling efficiency in Server_Room_B. Inspection using Ridgid-SeeSnake-Micro-CA300 inspection camera (12mm diameter probe, LED illumination, 3-foot flexible cable) reveals: Cable_Bundle_Bundle-445 (150-count Cat6 cables improperly routed under perforated tiles rather than cable runway, blocking 35% of tile free area), abandoned power cables from decommissioned equipment creating flow obstructions, and dust accumulation 3mm thickness on underfloor surface. Remediation includes: cable reorganization routing structured cabling through Chatsworth-CPI-Cable-Runway (12-inch width ladder rack suspended 18 inches above raised floor maintaining minimum 12-inch clearance below tiles per TIA-942 data center standard), abandoned cable removal (400 feet Cat5e cables, 200 feet power cables), and underfloor cleaning using HEPA-filtered industrial vacuum removing accumulated dust and debris.

Air pressure supervision testing verifies: air compressor maintains 40 PSI air pressure in dry-pipe section (preventing accidental water entry), low-pressure alarm activates at 38 PSI (Pressure_Switch_Potter-PSD-1 sends alarm signal to FACP), and high-pressure alarm deactivated (pressure relief valve set 50 PSI preventing over-pressurization).

**5-Year Obstruction Investigation**: NFPA-25 five-year interval requires internal piping inspection investigating microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) and obstruction accumulation. Inspection procedure: drain pre-action piping system (1,200 feet total pipe length, 4-inch main, 2-inch branches, 1-inch drops to heads), remove representative pipe sections at: main drain location (pipe end section showing deposits), midpoint riser section, and branch line end (most remote location from water supply). Pipe interior examination using VideoPipe-Scout-Pro borescope reveals: light tuberculation (rust scale formation <2mm thickness, acceptable for steel pipe age 8 years), no biological growth observed (dry-pipe system preventing bacterial growth unlike wet-pipe systems), and no significant obstructions restricting flow. Follow-up includes: internal pipe flushing using high-velocity water flow 10 FPS (feet per second) velocity for 5 minutes removing loose scale, nitrogen purge drying pipe interior preventing residual water corrosion, and pipe reassembly with new gaskets (Victaulic-Grade-E-EPDM-Gaskets suitable for potable water service) torqued per manufacturer specification 100 ft-lbs for 4-inch pipe joints.
