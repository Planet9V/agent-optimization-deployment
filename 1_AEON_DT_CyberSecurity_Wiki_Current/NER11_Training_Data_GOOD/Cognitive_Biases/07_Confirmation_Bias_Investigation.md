# Confirmation Bias in Security Investigations

**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>confirmation_bias</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** seeks information confirming existing beliefs while avoiding contradictory evidence.

## Investigation Distortions

- Threat modeling biased by **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>confirmation_bias</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** toward confirming known threats
- **<INSIDER_INDICATOR>data_exfiltration</INSIDER_INDICATOR>** investigations selectively gather evidence confirming exfiltration theory
- Security tool evaluations affected by **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>confirmation_bias</COGNITIVE_BIAS>**: testing scenarios confirming purchase decision
- **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>confirmation_bias</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** in red team exercises: interpreting findings to confirm security posture beliefs
- Alert tuning decisions biased toward confirming current tuning effectiveness through **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>confirmation_bias</COGNITIVE_BIAS>**
- **<INSIDER_INDICATOR>suspicious_network_activity</INSIDER_INDICATOR>** analyzed selectively for confirming evidence
