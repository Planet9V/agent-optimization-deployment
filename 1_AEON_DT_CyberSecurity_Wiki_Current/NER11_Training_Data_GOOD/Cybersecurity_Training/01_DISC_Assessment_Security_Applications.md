# DISC Assessment Security Applications and Insider Risk Profiles

## Framework Overview

The DISC model categorizes behavioral styles into four primary dimensions: Dominance (D), Influence (I), Steadiness (S), and Conscientiousness (C). Understanding these behavioral patterns helps identify insider threat indicators and security vulnerabilities within organizational contexts.
