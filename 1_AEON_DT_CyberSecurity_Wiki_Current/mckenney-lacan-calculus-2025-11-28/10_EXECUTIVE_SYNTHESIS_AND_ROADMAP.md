## Abstract

This document serves as the executive summary for the **Psychohistory Research Series (Vol 1-10)**. We have established a rigorous theoretical and technical framework for transforming Cyber Security from a reactive discipline into a predictive science. By integrating **NER11 Gold Standard** (Data), **Neo4j** (Structure), and **RUV-Swarm** (Dynamics), we can model the **Cyber-Social System** using the laws of Statistical Physics. This roadmap outlines the steps to operationalize this capability, moving from "Descriptive Analytics" to "Psychohistorical Control."

## 1. The Vision: From Reaction to Prediction

Current state: "We detected a breach."
Future state: "We detected a **Phase Transition** in the threat landscape. A breach is 85% probable in Sector 7 within 48 hours unless we intervene."

We achieve this by treating the cyber ecosystem not as a list of bugs, but as a **Complex Adaptive System** governed by:
1.  **Epidemic Thresholds** ($R_0$)
2.  **Opinion Dynamics** (Ising Model)
3.  **Adoption Cascades** (Granovetter Thresholds)
4.  **Critical Transitions** (Bifurcation Theory)

## 2. The Three Pillars of AEON

### Pillar 1: The Sensor Grid (NER11 Gold)
*   **Function**: Ingests the chaotic world of text.
*   **Output**: Structured Entities ($\sigma$), Relations ($J$), and Sentiment ($h$).
*   **Status**: **Training (F1 > 90%)**.

### Pillar 2: The State Matrix (Neo4j)
*   **Function**: Stores the topology and state of the system.
*   **Output**: Eigenvalues ($\lambda_{max}$), Communities, Paths.
*   **Status**: **Ready**.

### Pillar 3: The Predictor Engine (RUV-Swarm)
*   **Function**: Simulates the physics of the future.
*   **Output**: Probability distributions, Early Warning Signals (CSD).
*   **Status**: **Prototype**.

## 3. Readiness Assessment

| Capability | Level | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Collection** | **5/5** | NER11 Gold is state-of-the-art. |
| **Data Storage** | **5/5** | Neo4j Schema is defined. |
| **Mathematical Theory** | **4/5** | Frameworks (Ising, SIR) are adapted. |
| **Simulation Engine** | **2/5** | RUV-Swarm requires integration. |
| **Operational UI** | **1/5** | Dashboard needed. |

## 4. Strategic Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
*   **Objective**: Complete NER11 Training and Schema Definition.
*   **Milestone**: NER11 F1 > 92%. Neo4j Graph populated with static data.
*   **Deliverable**: The "Static Digital Twin".

### Phase 2: Integration (Months 4-6)
*   **Objective**: Connect NER11 to Neo4j for continuous hydration.
*   **Milestone**: Real-time ingestion pipeline active.
*   **Deliverable**: The "Live Digital Twin" (Descriptive).

### Phase 3: Simulation (Months 7-9)
*   **Objective**: Implement Ising and Granovetter models in RUV-Swarm.
*   **Milestone**: Successful backtesting of historical crises (e.g., Log4j).
*   **Deliverable**: The "Predictive Digital Twin" (Beta).

### Phase 4: Control (Months 10-12)
*   **Objective**: Deploy Early Warning System (EWS) and Counterfactual Analysis.
*   **Milestone**: Operational detection of Seldon Crises.
*   **Deliverable**: **Psychohistory Readiness**.

## 5. Conclusion

We are standing at the threshold of a new era in Cyber Security. The tools of physics—Hamiltonians, Eigenvalues, Phase Transitions—are no longer just for understanding the universe; they are for securing the digital world. The **AEON Digital Twin** is the machine that will make this possible.

> *"The future is not fixed, but it is probable. And probability is the domain of Psychohistory."*
