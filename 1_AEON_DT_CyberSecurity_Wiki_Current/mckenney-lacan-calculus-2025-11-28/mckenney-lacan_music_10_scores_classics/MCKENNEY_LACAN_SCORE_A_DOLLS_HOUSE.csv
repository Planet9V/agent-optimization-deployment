336,NORA,get you something to do.,0.11,0.3,0.87,0.2,R,8/10
337,MRS LINDE,"Yes, that was what I was thinking of.",0.11,0.3,0.87,0.7,R,8/10
338,NORA,"He must, Christine. Just leave it to me; I will broach the subject very",0.11,0.3,0.87,0.7,R,8/10
339,NORA,cleverly—I will think of something that will please him very much. It,0.11,0.3,0.87,0.2,R,8/10
340,NORA,will make me so happy to be of some use to you.,0.11,0.3,0.87,0.2,R,8/10
341,MRS LINDE,"How kind you are, Nora, to be so anxious to help me! It is doubly kind",0.11,0.45,0.87,0.7,R,8/10
342,MRS LINDE,"in you, for you know so little of the burdens and troubles of life.",0.11,0.3,0.87,0.2,R,8/10
343,NORA,I—? I know so little of them?,0.11,0.7,0.86,0.7,R,8/10
344,MRS LINDE,_[smiling]_. My dear! Small household cares and that sort of thing!—You,0.11,0.6,0.86,0.7,R,8/10
345,MRS LINDE,"are a child, Nora.",0.11,0.3,0.86,0.2,R,8/10
346,NORA,_[tosses her head and crosses the stage]_. You ought not to be so,0.11,0.3,0.86,0.7,R,8/10
347,NORA,superior.,0.11,0.3,0.86,0.2,R,8/10
348,MRS LINDE,No?,0.11,0.5,0.86,0.7,R,8/10
349,NORA,You are just like the others. They all think that I am incapable of,0.11,0.3,0.86,0.7,R,8/10
350,NORA,anything really serious—,0.11,0.3,0.86,0.2,R,8/10
351,MRS LINDE,"Come, come—",0.11,0.3,0.86,0.7,R,8/10
352,NORA,—that I have gone through nothing in this world of cares.,0.11,0.3,0.86,0.7,R,8/10
353,MRS LINDE,"But, my dear Nora, you have just told me all your troubles.",0.11,0.3,0.86,0.7,R,8/10
354,NORA,Pooh!—those were trifles. _[Lowering her voice.]_ I have not told you,0.11,0.45,0.86,0.7,R,8/10
355,NORA,the important thing.,0.11,0.3,0.86,0.2,R,8/10
356,MRS LINDE,The important thing? What do you mean?,0.11,0.7,0.86,0.7,R,8/10
357,NORA,"You look down upon me altogether, Christine—but you ought not to. You",0.11,0.3,0.86,0.7,R,8/10
358,NORA,"are proud, aren’t you, of having worked so hard and so long for your",0.11,0.3,0.86,0.2,R,8/10
359,NORA,mother?,0.11,0.5,0.86,0.2,R,8/10
360,MRS LINDE,"Indeed, I don’t look down on anyone. But it is true that I am both",0.11,0.3,0.86,0.7,R,8/10
361,MRS LINDE,proud and glad to think that I was privileged to make the end of my,0.11,0.3,0.86,0.2,R,8/10
362,MRS LINDE,mother’s life almost free from care.,0.11,0.3,0.86,0.2,R,8/10
363,NORA,And you are proud to think of what you have done for your brothers?,0.11,0.5,0.86,0.7,R,8/10
364,MRS LINDE,I think I have the right to be.,0.11,0.3,0.86,0.7,R,8/10
365,NORA,"I think so, too. But now, listen to this; I too have something to be",0.12,0.3,0.86,0.7,R,8/10
366,NORA,proud and glad of.,0.12,0.3,0.86,0.2,R,8/10
367,MRS LINDE,I have no doubt you have. But what do you refer to?,0.12,0.5,0.86,0.7,R,8/10
368,NORA,Speak low. Suppose Torvald were to hear! He mustn’t on any account—no,0.12,0.45,0.85,0.7,R,8/10
369,NORA,"one in the world must know, Christine, except you.",0.12,0.3,0.85,0.2,R,8/10
370,MRS LINDE,But what is it?,0.12,0.5,0.85,0.7,R,8/10
371,NORA,Come here. _[Pulls her down on the sofa beside her.]_ Now I will show,0.12,0.3,0.85,0.7,R,8/10
372,NORA,you that I too have something to be proud and glad of. It was I who,0.12,0.3,0.85,0.2,R,8/10
373,NORA,saved Torvald’s life.,0.12,0.3,0.85,0.2,R,8/10
374,MRS LINDE,“Saved”? How?,0.12,0.7,0.85,0.7,R,8/10
375,NORA,I told you about our trip to Italy. Torvald would never have recovered,0.12,0.3,0.85,0.7,R,8/10
376,NORA,if he had not gone there—,0.12,0.3,0.85,0.2,R,8/10
377,MRS LINDE,"Yes, but your father gave you the necessary funds.",0.12,0.3,0.85,0.7,R,8/10
378,NORA,"_[smiling]_. Yes, that is what Torvald and all the others think, but—",0.12,0.3,0.85,0.7,R,8/10
379,MRS LINDE,But—,0.12,0.3,0.85,0.7,R,8/10
380,NORA,Papa didn’t give us a shilling. It was I who procured the money.,0.12,0.3,0.85,0.7,R,8/10
381,MRS LINDE,You? All that large sum?,0.12,0.7,0.85,0.7,R,8/10
382,NORA,Two hundred and fifty pounds. What do you think of that?,0.12,0.5,0.85,0.7,R,8/10
383,MRS LINDE,"But, Nora, how could you possibly do it? Did you win a prize in the",0.12,0.5,0.85,0.7,R,8/10
384,MRS LINDE,Lottery?,0.12,0.5,0.85,0.2,R,8/10
385,NORA,_[contemptuously]_. In the Lottery? There would have been no credit in,0.12,0.5,0.85,0.7,R,8/10
386,NORA,that.,0.12,0.3,0.85,0.2,R,8/10
387,MRS LINDE,"But where did you get it from, then? Nora _[humming and smiling with an",0.12,0.5,0.85,0.7,R,8/10
388,MRS LINDE,"air of mystery]_. Hm, hm! Aha!",0.12,0.6,0.85,0.2,R,8/10
389,MRS LINDE,Because you couldn’t have borrowed it.,0.12,0.3,0.85,0.2,R,8/10
390,NORA,Couldn’t I? Why not?,0.12,0.7,0.85,0.7,R,8/10
391,MRS LINDE,"No, a wife cannot borrow without her husband’s consent.",0.12,0.3,0.85,0.7,R,8/10
392,NORA,"_[tossing her head]_. Oh, if it is a wife who has any head for",0.12,0.3,0.85,0.7,R,8/10
393,NORA,business—a wife who has the wit to be a little bit clever—,0.12,0.3,0.84,0.2,R,8/10
394,MRS LINDE,"I don’t understand it at all, Nora.",0.12,0.3,0.84,0.7,R,8/10
395,NORA,There is no need you should. I never said I had borrowed the money. I,0.12,0.3,0.84,0.7,R,8/10
396,NORA,may have got it some other way. _[Lies back on the sofa.]_ Perhaps I,0.12,0.3,0.84,0.2,R,8/10
397,NORA,got it from some other admirer. When anyone is as attractive as I am—,0.13,0.3,0.84,0.2,R,8/10
398,MRS LINDE,You are a mad creature.,0.23,0.3,0.84,0.7,R,7/10
399,NORA,"Now, you know you’re full of curiosity, Christine.",0.13,0.3,0.84,0.7,R,8/10
400,MRS LINDE,"Listen to me, Nora dear. Haven’t you been a little bit imprudent?",0.13,0.5,0.84,0.7,R,8/10
401,NORA,_[sits up straight]_. Is it imprudent to save your husband’s life?,0.13,0.5,0.84,0.7,R,8/10
402,MRS LINDE,"It seems to me imprudent, without his knowledge, to—",0.13,0.3,0.84,0.7,R,8/10
403,NORA,"But it was absolutely necessary that he should not know! My goodness,",0.13,0.45,0.84,0.7,R,8/10
404,NORA,can’t you understand that? It was necessary he should have no idea what,0.13,0.5,0.84,0.2,R,8/10
405,NORA,a dangerous condition he was in. It was to me that the doctors came and,0.13,0.3,0.84,0.2,R,8/10
406,NORA,"said that his life was in danger, and that the only thing to save him",0.13,0.3,0.84,0.2,R,8/10
407,NORA,"was to live in the south. Do you suppose I didn’t try, first of all, to",0.13,0.3,0.84,0.2,R,8/10
408,NORA,get what I wanted as if it were for myself? I told him how much I,0.13,0.5,0.84,0.2,R,8/10
409,NORA,should love to travel abroad like other young wives; I tried tears and,0.13,0.3,0.84,0.2,R,8/10
410,NORA,entreaties with him; I told him that he ought to remember the condition,0.13,0.3,0.84,0.2,R,8/10
411,NORA,"I was in, and that he ought to be kind and indulgent to me; I even",0.13,0.3,0.84,0.2,R,8/10
412,NORA,"hinted that he might raise a loan. That nearly made him angry,",0.23,0.3,0.84,0.2,R,7/10
413,NORA,"Christine. He said I was thoughtless, and that it was his duty as my",0.13,0.3,0.84,0.2,R,8/10
414,NORA,husband not to indulge me in my whims and caprices—as I believe he,0.13,0.3,0.84,0.2,R,8/10
415,NORA,"called them. Very well, I thought, you must be saved—and that was how I",0.13,0.3,0.84,0.2,R,8/10
416,NORA,came to devise a way out of the difficulty—,0.13,0.3,0.84,0.2,R,8/10
417,MRS LINDE,And did your husband never get to know from your father that the money,0.13,0.3,0.84,0.7,R,8/10
418,MRS LINDE,had not come from him?,0.13,0.5,0.84,0.2,R,8/10
419,NORA,"No, never. Papa died just at that time. I had meant to let him into the",0.13,0.3,0.83,0.7,R,8/10
420,NORA,"secret and beg him never to reveal it. But he was so ill then—alas,",0.13,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
421,NORA,there never was any need to tell him.,0.13,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
422,MRS LINDE,And since then have you never told your secret to your husband?,0.13,0.5,0.83,0.7,R,8/10
423,NORA,"Good Heavens, no! How could you think so? A man who has such strong",0.13,0.65,0.83,0.7,R,8/10
424,NORA,"opinions about these things! And besides, how painful and humiliating",0.13,0.45,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
425,NORA,"it would be for Torvald, with his manly independence, to know that he",0.13,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
426,NORA,owed me anything! It would upset our mutual relations altogether; our,0.13,0.45,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
427,NORA,beautiful happy home would no longer be what it is now.,0.13,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
428,MRS LINDE,Do you mean never to tell him about it?,0.14,0.5,0.83,0.7,R,8/10
429,NORA,"_[meditatively, and with a half smile]_. Yes—someday, perhaps, after",0.14,0.3,0.83,0.7,R,8/10
430,NORA,"many years, when I am no longer as nice-looking as I am now. Don’t",0.14,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
431,NORA,"laugh at me! I mean, of course, when Torvald is no longer as devoted to",0.14,0.45,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
432,NORA,me as he is now; when my dancing and dressing-up and reciting have,0.14,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
433,NORA,palled on him; then it may be a good thing to have something in,0.14,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
434,NORA,reserve—_[Breaking off.]_ What nonsense! That time will never come.,0.14,0.45,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
435,NORA,"Now, what do you think of my great secret, Christine? Do you still",0.14,0.5,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
436,NORA,"think I am of no use? I can tell you, too, that this affair has caused",0.14,0.5,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
437,NORA,me a lot of worry. It has been by no means easy for me to meet my,0.14,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
438,NORA,engagements punctually. I may tell you that there is something that is,0.14,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
439,NORA,"called, in business, quarterly interest, and another thing called",0.14,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
440,NORA,"payment in installments, and it is always so dreadfully difficult to",0.14,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
441,NORA,"manage them. I have had to save a little here and there, where I could,",0.14,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
442,NORA,you understand. I have not been able to put aside much from my,0.14,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
443,NORA,"housekeeping money, for Torvald must have a good table. I couldn’t let",0.14,0.3,0.83,0.2,R,8/10
444,NORA,my children be shabbily dressed; I have felt obliged to use up all he,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
445,NORA,"gave me for them, the sweet little darlings!",0.14,0.45,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
446,MRS LINDE,"So it has all had to come out of your own necessaries of life, poor",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
447,MRS LINDE,Nora?,0.14,0.5,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
448,NORA,"Of course. Besides, I was the one responsible for it. Whenever Torvald",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
449,NORA,"has given me money for new dresses and such things, I have never spent",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
450,NORA,more than half of it; I have always bought the simplest and cheapest,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
451,NORA,"things. Thank Heaven, any clothes look well on me, and so Torvald has",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
452,NORA,"never noticed it. But it was often very hard on me, Christine—because",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
453,NORA,"it is delightful to be really well dressed, isn’t it?",0.14,0.5,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
454,MRS LINDE,Quite so.,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
455,NORA,"Well, then I have found other ways of earning money. Last winter I was",0.14,0.3,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
456,NORA,lucky enough to get a lot of copying to do; so I locked myself up and,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
457,NORA,sat writing every evening until quite late at night. Many a time I was,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
458,NORA,desperately tired; but all the same it was a tremendous pleasure to sit,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
459,NORA,there working and earning money. It was like being a man.,0.14,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
460,MRS LINDE,How much have you been able to pay off in that way?,0.15,0.5,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
461,NORA,"I can’t tell you exactly. You see, it is very difficult to keep an",0.15,0.3,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
462,NORA,account of a business matter of that kind. I only know that I have paid,0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
463,NORA,every penny that I could scrape together. Many a time I was at my wits’,0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
464,NORA,end. _[Smiles.]_ Then I used to sit here and imagine that a rich old,0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
465,NORA,gentleman had fallen in love with me—,0.15,0.3,0.82,0.2,R,8/10
466,MRS LINDE,What! Who was it?,0.15,0.65,0.82,0.7,R,8/10
467,NORA,Be quiet!—that he had died; and that when his will was opened it,0.15,0.45,0.82,0.7,R,8/10

471,NORA,"Good gracious, can’t you understand? There was no old gentleman at all;",0.15,0.5,0.81,0.7,R,8/10
472,NORA,"it was only something that I used to sit here and imagine, when I",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
473,NORA,couldn’t think of any way of procuring money. But it’s all the same,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
474,NORA,"now; the tiresome old person can stay where he is, as far as I am",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
475,NORA,"concerned; I don’t care about him or his will either, for I am free",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
476,NORA,"from care now. _[Jumps up.]_ My goodness, it’s delightful to think of,",0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
477,NORA,"Christine! Free from care! To be able to be free from care, quite free",0.15,0.6,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
478,NORA,from care; to be able to play and romp with the children; to be able to,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
479,NORA,keep the house beautifully and have everything just as Torvald likes,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10

481,NORA,Perhaps we shall be able to take a little trip—perhaps I shall see the,0.15,0.3,0.81,0.2,R,8/10
