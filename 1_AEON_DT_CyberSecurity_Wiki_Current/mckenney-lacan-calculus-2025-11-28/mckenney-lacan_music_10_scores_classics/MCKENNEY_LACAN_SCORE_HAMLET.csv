1087,POLONIUS,What said he?,0.22,0.5,0.73,0.7,R,7/10
1088,OPHELIA,He took me by the wrist and held me hard;,0.22,0.3,0.73,0.7,R,7/10
1089,OPHELIA,Then goes he to the length of all his arm;,0.22,0.3,0.73,0.2,R,7/10
1090,OPHELIA,"And with his other hand thus o’er his brow,",0.22,0.3,0.73,0.2,R,7/10
1091,OPHELIA,He falls to such perusal of my face,0.22,0.3,0.73,0.2,R,7/10
1092,OPHELIA,"As he would draw it. Long stay’d he so,",0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1093,OPHELIA,"At last,—a little shaking of mine arm,",0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1094,OPHELIA,"And thrice his head thus waving up and down,",0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1095,OPHELIA,He rais’d a sigh so piteous and profound,0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1096,OPHELIA,As it did seem to shatter all his bulk,0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1097,OPHELIA,"And end his being. That done, he lets me go,",0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1098,OPHELIA,And with his head over his shoulder turn’d,0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1099,OPHELIA,"He seem’d to find his way without his eyes,",0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1100,OPHELIA,"For out o’ doors he went without their help,",0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1101,OPHELIA,And to the last bended their light on me.,0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1102,POLONIUS,"Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.",0.22,0.3,0.72,0.7,R,7/10
1103,POLONIUS,"This is the very ecstasy of love,",0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1104,POLONIUS,"Whose violent property fordoes itself,",0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1105,POLONIUS,"And leads the will to desperate undertakings,",0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1106,POLONIUS,As oft as any passion under heaven,0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1107,POLONIUS,"That does afflict our natures. I am sorry,—",0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1108,POLONIUS,"What, have you given him any hard words of late?",0.22,0.5,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1109,OPHELIA,"No, my good lord; but as you did command,",0.22,0.3,0.72,0.7,R,7/10
1110,OPHELIA,I did repel his letters and denied,0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1111,OPHELIA,His access to me.,0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1112,POLONIUS,That hath made him mad.,0.32,0.3,0.72,0.7,L,6/10
1113,POLONIUS,I am sorry that with better heed and judgement,0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1114,POLONIUS,"I had not quoted him. I fear’d he did but trifle,",0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1115,POLONIUS,And meant to wreck thee. But beshrew my jealousy!,0.22,0.45,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1116,POLONIUS,It seems it is as proper to our age,0.22,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1117,POLONIUS,To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions,0.23,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
1118,POLONIUS,As it is common for the younger sort,0.23,0.3,0.72,0.2,R,7/10
