2. For each analysis, create an engaging narrative composition
3. Save each narrative to the "narratives/" directory with filename format: "YYYY-MM-DD-article-title-narrative.md"
4. Generate Neo4j Cypher queries for each analysis
5. Save queries to the "cypher_queries/" directory with filename format: "YYYY-MM-DD-article-title-cypher.txt"

FOR EACH ANALYSIS:
1. Read the analysis carefully
2. Apply narrative techniques from ARTIFACT_6: NARRATIVE_TECHNIQUES
   Purpose: Create engaging, accessible content while maintaining objectivity

   Purpose: Make complex networks of relationships accessible and engaging
6. Format knowledge graph data using ARTIFACT_11: OBSIDIAN_INTEGRATION_GUIDE
   Purpose: Ensure proper formatting for Obsidian visualization
7. Generate database queries using ARTIFACT_10: NEO4J_CYPHER_TEMPLATE
   Purpose: Create importable queries for Neo4j database integration
8. Verify objectivity again using ARTIFACT_4: OBJECTIVITY_CHECKLIST
   Purpose: Ensure narrative maintains the same neutrality as the analysis

ANALYSES TO PROCESS:
[LIST OF ANALYSIS FILENAMES IN atomic_notes/ DIRECTORY]

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a separate narrative for each analysis
2. Include all sections from the narrative template
3. Generate complete Neo4j Cypher queries for each analysis
4. Verify each narrative meets objectivity standards
5. Report completion status after processing each analysis
