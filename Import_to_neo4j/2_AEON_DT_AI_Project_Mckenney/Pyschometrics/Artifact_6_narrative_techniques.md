NARRATIVE ENHANCEMENT TECHNIQUES:

1. CLEAR STRUCTURE
   - Begin with a concise statement of key facts
   - Organize information in a logical progression
   - Use subheadings to guide readers through different aspects
   - Conclude with context rather than opinion

2. ENGAGING LANGUAGE
   - Use varied sentence structure while maintaining neutrality
   - Employ concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts
   - Create smooth transitions between different perspectives
   - Maintain active voice where appropriate

3. PERSPECTIVE INTEGRATION
   - Weave different viewpoints into a coherent narrative
   - Present contrasting views in proximity for easy comparison
   - Use transitional phrases to show relationships between perspectives
   - Ensure equal depth and fair characterization for all viewpoints

4. CONNECTION VISUALIZATION
   - Describe relationships between concepts in spatial terms
   - Use metaphors that clarify rather than bias understanding
   - Create "maps" of how issues connect to broader contexts
   - Show multiple ways of interpreting connections

5. PSYCHOANALYTIC ACCESSIBILITY
   - Translate complex theoretical concepts into accessible language
   - Use concrete examples to illustrate abstract psychoanalytic patterns
   - Connect theoretical insights to observable phenomena
   - Present psychoanalytic perspectives as one of multiple interpretive frameworks

6. BIAS ILLUMINATION
   - Describe media patterns in clear, non-judgmental language
   - Use parallel structure when comparing different framing approaches
   - Illustrate how the same facts can be presented differently
   - Help readers recognize framing without prescribing reactions

7. READER ENGAGEMENT
   - Address common questions readers might have
   - Provide context that helps readers evaluate information
   - Highlight aspects that may receive less attention in typical coverage
