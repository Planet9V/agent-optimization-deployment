# Knowledge Graphs: The Foundation of Modern Asset Management in Lean Organizations

In today's complex digital landscape, organizations face increasing challenges in understanding what assets they have, where they are located, how they interrelate, and what risks they pose. Knowledge graphs have emerged as a powerful solution for asset management, providing organizations with the ability to model complex relationships between assets while maintaining the flexibility needed to adapt to changing business requirements. This approach naturally aligns with lean management principles, particularly the 5S methodology, by enabling organizations to create order from chaos, establish clear relationships, and maintain a comprehensive view of their asset ecosystem without the constraints of traditional database schemas.

## The Convergence of Knowledge Graphs and Asset Management

Knowledge graphs represent a fundamental shift in how organizations understand and manage their assets. Unlike traditional relational databases that require rigid schemas and struggle with complex relationships, knowledge graphs store relationships as first-class citizens rather than as afterthoughts to be expensively computed later. This approach creates a powerful foundation for asset management by enabling organizations to visualize, understand, and analyze information about assets across multiple data sources[8](https://www.comparethecloud.net/business/why-a-digital-twin-graph-will-help-manage-real-world-complexity-at-scale/). The graph structure allows business assets to be natively connected to their neighbors, creating a rich network that becomes more useful as it grows and expands.

For asset management, knowledge graphs serve as semantic search engines that can find unexpected connections between assets, their components, their owners, and their relationships to other systems. They can extract millions of connections from diverse sources of information, including asset registers, maintenance records, configuration files, and documentation, storing these connections in a way that produces new insights that would otherwise remain hidden[1](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2020/07/16/how-knowledge-graphs-can-help-asset-managers-in-2020/). This capability is particularly valuable for organizations dealing with complex asset ecosystems that span multiple domains, such as IT infrastructure, operational technology, physical buildings, and equipment.

The Enterprise Knowledge Graph has been described as "the heart of a connected inventory" that provides visibility about interconnected business processes and operational infrastructure[6](https://info.stardog.com/connected-inventory). This interconnected approach enables organizations to trace assets to all applications and access them through contextual search, creating a comprehensive foundation for resilience, risk analysis, data governance, and regulatory reporting. By representing the reality of assets and their related information, knowledge graphs provide the holistic view needed for effective asset management in today's complex environments.

## Aligning Knowledge Graphs with 5S and Lean Principles

The 5S methodology from lean manufacturing provides a structured approach to workplace organization, focusing on five key principles: Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain[2](https://www.re-sourcepartners.com/5-step-process/)[16](https://www.brightlysoftware.com/blog/5s-methodology-lean-manufacturing). Knowledge graphs naturally align with and enhance these principles when applied to asset management, creating a powerful combination that drives efficiency and effectiveness.

At the most fundamental level, knowledge graphs support the "Sort" principle by helping organizations eliminate what's not needed. Through comprehensive asset discovery and relationship mapping, organizations can identify redundant assets, unused systems, and obsolete equipment. This visibility enables decision-makers to prioritize which assets to retain and which to retire, reducing complexity and cost in the asset ecosystem.

Knowledge graphs particularly excel in supporting the "Set in Order" principle, which focuses on identifying and organizing what remains after sorting. By modeling assets as nodes and their relationships as edges, knowledge graphs create a natural organizational structure that reflects how assets relate to one another in the real world[9](https://neo4j.com/use-cases/knowledge-graph/). This organization makes it easier to locate assets, understand their dependencies, and visualize their place in the broader ecosystem. The graph structure creates an intuitive order that aligns with how people naturally think about relationships between entities.

The "Standardize" principle from 5S emphasizes making the first three steps habitual with daily adherence. Knowledge graphs support this principle by providing a consistent framework for representing assets and their relationships, regardless of the specific asset type or domain. This standardization creates a common language for discussing and managing assets across the organization, breaking down silos and enabling more effective collaboration between teams. Once established, this standard approach becomes the foundation for ongoing asset management activities.

Finally, knowledge graphs support the "Sustain" principle by making asset management a way of daily life. The flexible nature of graph databases allows organizations to maintain their asset inventory as a living system that evolves with the business, rather than a static snapshot that quickly becomes outdated[9](https://neo4j.com/use-cases/knowledge-graph/). This sustainable approach ensures that the asset management system remains valuable and relevant over time, adapting to new asset types, changing business requirements, and evolving technology landscapes.

## The Critical Foundation: Knowing What You Have

Before any organization can effectively manage its assets, it must first know what assets it has. This fundamental requirement represents the critical foundation for all asset management activities, and it's an area where many organizations struggle. As noted in industry research, "many organisations can't even begin to defend their assets without knowing what they have in their OT environment and the risk exposure to their organisation"[3](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/undeniable-power-digital-twins-identity-knowledge-graphs-hope-frank-rkwac). This challenge becomes increasingly acute as environments grow more complex, with assets spanning multiple domains, systems, and locations.

Knowledge graphs address this challenge by providing a comprehensive approach to asset discovery and inventory management. They "assess and catalogue an organisation's assets to gain a clear picture of what they have and what they need to defend against immediate threats"[3](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/undeniable-power-digital-twins-identity-knowledge-graphs-hope-frank-rkwac). This cataloging process creates the visibility needed to understand the full scope of the asset landscape, identifying not just individual assets but also the relationships and dependencies between them.

The asset inventory graph approach employed by tools like Fix Inventory demonstrates the power of this model. In this approach, "all resources from all cloud providers, accounts, regions and all resource types become nodes in the graph," creating a comprehensive picture of the organization's assets[12](https://fixinventory.org/concepts/asset-inventory-graph). But the graph goes beyond simple inventory by also encoding how resources relate to each other—for example, showing that a compute instance might have a volume and is attached to a network interface, which in turn might be the target of a load balancer inside a security group within a VPC. This comprehensive view provides the "superpower" of showing a complete picture of assets and how they relate to each other.

For organizations pursuing digital transformation initiatives, this foundational understanding becomes even more critical. As noted by industry experts, organizations should "take the time to build a capable cybersecurity foundation that considers everything from legacy to high-tech assets and from existing to new IT infrastructure before digital transformation can be safely executed"[3](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/undeniable-power-digital-twins-identity-knowledge-graphs-hope-frank-rkwac). Knowledge graphs provide the flexible yet comprehensive foundation needed for this understanding, enabling organizations to proceed with transformation initiatives from a position of knowledge rather than uncertainty.

## Schema Flexibility: Assets as Nodes

One of the most powerful aspects of knowledge graphs for asset management is their inherent flexibility. Unlike traditional relational databases that require predefined schemas and struggle with frequent changes, knowledge graphs allow organizations to represent assets as nodes without the constraints of rigid schemas. This flexibility enables organizations to adapt quickly to changing business requirements, introduce new asset types, and capture unique attributes without rebuilding the entire database structure.

Knowledge graphs are designed to "introduce new data, properties, and relationships without rebuilding the database or modifying application code"[9](https://neo4j.com/use-cases/knowledge-graph/). This adaptability is particularly valuable in asset management, where the types of assets and the information needed about them continuously evolve. New technologies, changing business requirements, and emerging regulatory demands all require adjustments to how assets are tracked and managed. With knowledge graphs, these adjustments can be made incrementally without disrupting existing systems or requiring massive data migration efforts.

The property graph model used in many knowledge graph implementations allows organizations to "represent structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data and their relationships naturally using nodes, relationships, and properties"[9](https://neo4j.com/use-cases/knowledge-graph/). This representation "eliminates the translation from conceptual to physical models," making it easier to capture the real-world complexity of asset ecosystems without artificial constraints. Assets and their properties can be modeled as they exist in reality, rather than forced into predefined tables and columns that may not accurately reflect their true nature.

This flexibility extends to the types of questions that can be asked about assets. Knowledge graphs enable organizations to "write concise, flexible queries with fewer lines of code, tapping into powerful features like quantified path patterns for efficient graph traversal and pattern matching"[9](https://neo4j.com/use-cases/knowledge-graph/). These capabilities allow asset managers to explore complex relationships and dependencies that would be difficult or impossible to query in traditional database systems. For example, a simple query might answer the question, "Which assets depend on this component that's scheduled for maintenance?" or "What's the potential impact radius if this system fails?"

## Full-Stack Visibility: Integrating HBOMs, SBOMs, and Relationships

Modern asset management requires visibility across the full stack of components that make up each asset, including hardware bill of materials (HBOM), software bill of materials (SBOM), and the relationships between these components. Knowledge graphs excel at integrating this diverse information into a cohesive whole, providing the comprehensive visibility needed for effective asset management without the weight of traditional schemas.

The integration of SBOMs into asset management has become increasingly critical as organizations recognize the security implications of their software supply chain. Knowledge graphs provide a powerful way to ingest and analyze SBOM data, as demonstrated by projects like GUAC (Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition), which uses a graph database to "ingest metadata and information about artifacts, and then allows for querying, understanding and visualizing the relationships between those different types of artifacts"[4](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/news/365532041/SBOM-graph-database-aims-to-be-cloud-security-secret-sauce). This approach enables organizations to identify potential vulnerabilities in their software components and understand the relationships between different artifacts in their environment.

When SBOMs are ingested into a knowledge graph, they become part of a broader asset management ecosystem where "components will be enriched with crucial information, including details such as whether a CVE is in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog, exploit availability (with references), CVSS scores, EPSS scores, and more"[19](https://www.netrise.io/xiot-security-blog/sbom-ingest). This enrichment creates a much more valuable asset inventory than a simple list of components, providing the context needed for effective risk management and decision-making.

Knowledge graphs also excel at integrating hardware components and their relationships into the asset management picture. The Asset Life Cycle Knowledge Graph approach demonstrates how "graph databases are gaining interest, in both the research community and industry, over traditional relational databasing techniques for their ability to efficiently integrate, store and retrieve heterogeneous data"[11](https://itc.scix.net/pdfs/w78-2024-paper_81.pdf). This integration capability enables organizations to combine information from building management systems, supplier information, and asset registers into a cohesive view that supports lifecycle management decisions.

Perhaps most powerfully, knowledge graphs enable the creation of digital twins that provide virtual representations of physical assets. These digital twins "enable organizations to visualize, understand, and analyze information about assets across multiple data sources, improving efficiency and decision making across systems"[20](https://enterprise-knowledge.com/digital-twins-and-knowledge-graphs/). By combining real-time data from sensors with historical maintenance records and other contextual information, digital twins create rich representations of assets that support fault detection, predictive maintenance, and optimization of asset performance.

## Conclusion: Knowledge Graphs as the Future of Asset Management

As organizations continue to navigate increasingly complex asset ecosystems, knowledge graphs have emerged as the future of asset management, providing the flexibility, visibility, and integration capabilities needed to truly understand and optimize asset portfolios. By aligning with lean principles and the 5S methodology, knowledge graphs enable organizations to create order from chaos, establish clear relationships, and maintain a comprehensive view of their assets without the constraints of traditional schemas.

The fundamental principle that "you must know what you have" serves as the grounding for all asset management efforts, and knowledge graphs provide the most effective way to establish and maintain this knowledge in today's complex environments. By representing assets as nodes and their relationships as edges, knowledge graphs create a natural organizational structure that reflects the real world while remaining adaptable to changing requirements.

The ability to integrate full-stack information—including hardware components, software components, and their relationships—without the weight of rigid schemas enables organizations to maintain comprehensive visibility across their entire asset ecosystem. This visibility supports better decision-making, more effective risk management, and optimized asset performance, ultimately delivering greater value from the organization's asset investments.

As digital transformation initiatives continue to reshape how organizations operate, the flexible yet powerful nature of knowledge graphs will become increasingly essential for effective asset management. Organizations that embrace this approach will gain the comprehensive understanding needed to navigate complexity, reduce risk, and extract maximum value from their assets in an ever-changing business landscape.
