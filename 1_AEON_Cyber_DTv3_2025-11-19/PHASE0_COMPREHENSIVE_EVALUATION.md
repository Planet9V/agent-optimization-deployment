# PHASE 0: COMPREHENSIVE CAPABILITY EVALUATION

**File**: PHASE0_COMPREHENSIVE_EVALUATION.md
**Created**: 2025-11-19 22:05:00 UTC
**Protocol**: AEON PROJECT TASK EXECUTION PROTOCOL
**Task**: Integrate ALL files from 11_Key_Parts and 10_EXTRA folders

---

## Step 0.1: RUV-SWARM Capability Evaluation

**Task Complexity Score**: 0.85 (HIGH)
- Scope: Review and integrate ALL files from 2 additional folders
- Components: Unknown number of files (discovering now)
- Integration: Must preserve all detail, copy entire files if needed
- Organization: Maintain clean structure while adding comprehensive detail

**Recommended Topology**: HIERARCHICAL
- Rationale: Coordinated file integration across multiple categories
- Queen: Overall package coordinator
- Workers: Category-specific integrators

**Max Agents Needed**: 10
1. Inventory Agent (catalog all files in 11_Key_Parts and 10_EXTRA)
2. Governance Integrator (merge governance files)
3. Architecture Integrator (merge architecture files)
4. Technical Integrator (merge technical specs)
5. Business Integrator (merge business case files)
6. Implementation Integrator (merge implementation plans)
7. Training Data Organizer (reference training materials)
8. Cross-Reference Validator (ensure consistency)
9. Quality Assurance (completeness check)
10. Documentation Coordinator (final organization)

**Strategy**: SPECIALIZED (each agent handles specific category)

## Step 0.2: Task Analysis

**Current State**:
- 28 documents in main package (952 KB)
- 11_Key_Parts folder: DISCOVERED, analyzing contents
- 10_EXTRA folder: DISCOVERED, analyzing contents

**Task Requirements** (User directive):
- Consider EVERY FILE in both folders
- EXTREMELY DETAILED integration
- COPY ENTIRE FILES if needed
- Create standalone complete development documentation
- NO TRUNCATION

**Execution Strategy**:
- Inventory all files
- Categorize by destination folder
- Copy/integrate systematically
- Validate completeness

## Step 0.3: Neural Pattern Selection

**Applicable Patterns**:
- SYSTEMS THINKING: For understanding file relationships
- CRITICAL THINKING: For identifying essential vs redundant
- CONVERGENT: For integration into organized structure

**Memory Tracking**:
- Namespace: aeon-comprehensive-package
- Keys: file-inventory, integration-decisions, completeness-check

**Decision**: Proceed to Phase 1 - Strategy Synthesis
