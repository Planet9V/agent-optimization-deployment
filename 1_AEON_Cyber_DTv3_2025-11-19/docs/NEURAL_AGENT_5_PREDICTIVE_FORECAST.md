### For Risk Mitigation

**Recommendation**: Deploy Nuclear sector last with dedicated time
- 8-hour allocation vs 4-hour standard
- Expert consultation for security requirements
- Comprehensive testing before production

### For ROI Achievement

**Recommendation**: Focus on 8-15x target, not 150x
