# PHASE 0: CAPABILITY EVALUATION - AEON Cyber DT v3.0

**Date**: 2025-11-19 22:00:00 UTC
**Task**: Improve and validate clean implementation package
**Protocol**: AEON PROJECT TASK EXECUTION PROTOCOL

## Step 0.1: RUV-SWARM Capability Inventory

**Task Complexity**: 0.65 (moderate-high)
- Scope: Review 27 documents, validate completeness, improve organization
- Components: 7 folders, multiple document types
- Dependencies: Constitutional compliance, vision alignment, technical accuracy

**Recommended Topology**: HIERARCHICAL
- Rationale: Coordinated validation across multiple document types
- Queen agent: Coordinate overall package quality
- Worker agents: Validate specific document categories

**Max Agents**: 8
- 1 Coordinator (package overview)
- 1 Governance reviewer (Constitution, PRD)
- 1 Architecture reviewer (6-level design)
- 1 Technical reviewer (specs, schema)
- 1 Business reviewer (ROI, market analysis)
- 1 Implementation reviewer (roadmap, TASKMASTER)
- 1 Cross-reference validator (ensure consistency)
- 1 Quality assurance (final check)

**Strategy**: BALANCED (quality + completeness)

## Step 0.2: Current Package Assessment

**Documents Created**: 27 files, 952 KB
**Completeness**: ~85% (need training data reference, may need enhancements)

**Potential Issues Identified**:
1. Training data folder empty (need reference doc)
2. Some cross-references may be incomplete
3. Version consistency check needed
4. README may need enhancement

## Step 0.3: Neural Pattern Selection

**Applicable Patterns**:
- **CRITICAL THINKING**: For validation and quality assurance
- **SYSTEMS THINKING**: For cross-document consistency
- **CONVERGENT**: For completeness verification
- **ADAPTIVE**: For improvement recommendations

## Decision: Proceed with validation and improvement
