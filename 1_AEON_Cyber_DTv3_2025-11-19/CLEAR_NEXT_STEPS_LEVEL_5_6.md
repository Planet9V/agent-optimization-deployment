## 📋 YOUR NEXT PROMPT (Copy/Paste This)

```
use claude-swarm with qdrant to:

EXECUTE TASKMASTER LEVEL 5 DEPLOYMENT: INFORMATION_STREAMS

Deploy Level 5 using pre-validated architecture:
- Load: TaskMaster_Levels_5_and_6/Level5_PreBuilder/04_Level5_PreValidated_Architecture.json
- Deploy: 6,000 Level 5 nodes (InformationEvent, GeopoliticalEvent, ThreatFeed)
- Integrate: Connect to 316K CVEs, 16 sectors, cognitive biases
- Validate: <5 min latency, ≥0.75 correlation
- Update Schema Governance Board with Level 5
```

**Expected Time**: 30-60 minutes
**Expected Output**: 6,000 Level 5 nodes deployed with evidence

### PHASE 2: Level 5 Deployment (NEXT - Copy/Paste Above)

```
EXECUTE TASKMASTER LEVEL 5 DEPLOYMENT: INFORMATION_STREAMS
```

**What Happens**:
- 10-agent swarm deploys Level 5
- InformationEvent nodes: 5,000
- GeopoliticalEvent nodes: 500
- ThreatFeed nodes: 3
- CognitiveBias expansion: 7 → 30
- Integration with 16 sectors
- Validation: Latency <5 min, correlation ≥0.75

**Expected Time**: 30-60 minutes
**Deliverable**: Level 5 operational, real-time event pipeline

---

### PHASE 3: Verify Level 5 Deployment

```
use claude-swarm with qdrant to:

VERIFY LEVEL 5 DEPLOYMENT: INFORMATION_STREAMS

Run validation queries:
- Count InformationEvent nodes (expect: 5,000)
- Count GeopoliticalEvent nodes (expect: 500)
- Test event latency (<5 min)
- Test correlation (≥0.75)
- Verify integration with 16 sectors
```

**Expected Time**: 10-15 minutes
**Deliverable**: Validation report with evidence

---

### PHASE 4: Level 6 Pre-Builder

```
use claude-swarm with qdrant to:

EXECUTE LEVEL 6 PRE-BUILDER: PREDICTIVE_ANALYTICS

Research requirements for:
- HistoricalPattern nodes (100K+)
- FutureThreat nodes (10K+)
- WhatIfScenario nodes (1K+)
- NHITS model architecture
- ROI calculation engine

Create pre-validated Level 6 architecture
```

**Expected Time**: 2-3 hours
**Deliverable**: Level 6 pre-validated architecture

---

### PHASE 5: Level 6 Deployment

```
use claude-swarm with qdrant to:

EXECUTE TASKMASTER LEVEL 6 DEPLOYMENT: PREDICTIVE_ANALYTICS

Deploy Level 6 using pre-validated architecture:
- Deploy HistoricalPattern nodes (100K)
- Deploy FutureThreat nodes (10K)
- Deploy WhatIfScenario nodes (1K)
- Train NHITS model
- Validate: Accuracy ≥75%, ROI >100x
```

**Expected Time**: 4-6 hours
**Deliverable**: Operational psychohistory predictions

---

### PHASE 6: Verify Level 6 Deployment

```
use claude-swarm with qdrant to:

VERIFY LEVEL 6 DEPLOYMENT: PREDICTIVE_ANALYTICS

Run validation queries:
- Count HistoricalPattern nodes (expect: 100K)
- Count FutureThreat nodes (expect: 10K)
- Test prediction accuracy (≥75%)
- Test ROI calculations (>100x)
- Answer McKenney Questions 7-8
```

**Expected Time**: 15-20 minutes
**Deliverable**: Full psychohistory operational

---

### PHASE 7: Complete Integration

```
use claude-swarm with qdrant to:

INTEGRATE LEVELS 0-6 COMPLETE SYSTEM

Verify end-to-end psychohistory:
- Equipment (L0-1) → SBOM (L2) → Threats (L3) → Psychology (L4) → Events (L5) → Predictions (L6)
- Test complete 6-level query
- Generate sample prediction
- Calculate ROI for intervention
- Create board-ready report
```

**Expected Time**: 30 minutes
**Deliverable**: Complete AEON Cyber Digital Twin operational
