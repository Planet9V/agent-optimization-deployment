# PHASE 0: CAPABILITY EVALUATION - FORMAL TASKMASTER CREATION

**File**: PHASE0_TASKMASTER_EVALUATION.md
**Created**: 2025-11-19 22:20:00 UTC
**Protocol**: AEON PROJECT TASK EXECUTION PROTOCOL
**Task**: Create FORMAL TASKMASTER list with REAL validation (no theatre)
**Target**: AEON Cyber DTv3 in /home/jim/2_OXOT_Projects_Dev/1_AEON_Cyber_DTv3_2025-11-19

## Step 0.1: RUV-SWARM Capability Evaluation

**Task Complexity Score**: 0.90 (VERY HIGH)
- Scope: Create formal TASKMASTER for entire AEON Cyber DT implementation
- Requirements: REAL tasks, REAL validation, constitutional compliance
- Deliverable: Formal task list that prevents "development theatre"
- Validation: Every task must have evidence-based completion criteria

**Recommended Topology**: HIERARCHICAL
- Queen: TASKMASTER coordinator (overall task structure)
- Workers: Task definers per domain (governance, architecture, implementation, validation)

**Max Agents**: 12
1. **TASKMASTER Architect** - Overall task structure and hierarchy
2. **Constitution Compliance Officer** - Ensure no development theatre
3. **Governance Task Definer** - Constitutional tasks
4. **Architecture Task Definer** - 6-level implementation tasks
5. **Technical Task Definer** - Database, API, integration tasks
6. **ML Task Definer** - Prediction engine tasks
7. **Sector Deployment Task Definer** - 16-sector expansion tasks
8. **Validation Criteria Designer** - Evidence requirements per task
9. **Test Designer** - Test cases for each task
10. **Integration Validator** - Cross-component validation tasks
11. **Quality Assurance Designer** - QA gates and criteria
12. **Documentation Task Definer** - Documentation requirements

**Strategy**: SPECIALIZED (each agent defines tasks for their domain)

## Step 0.2: Constitutional Requirements Analysis

**Constitution Article I, Section 1.2, Rule 3**: NO DEVELOPMENT THEATRE
> "Evidence of completion = working code, passing tests, populated databases"
> "'COMPLETE' means deliverable exists and functions"

**Requirements for REAL Tasks** (not theatre):
1. ✅ **Specific deliverables**: "Deploy X nodes to Neo4j" (not "design schema")
2. ✅ **Evidence-based**: "Run Cypher query: MATCH (n:Equipment) RETURN count(n) = 2014"
3. ✅ **Testable**: "Execute test suite, 90%+ pass rate"
4. ✅ **Measurable**: "API response time <200ms (measured)"

**Anti-Theatre Criteria**:
- ❌ NO "design" tasks without implementation
- ❌ NO "plan" tasks without execution
- ❌ NO "document" tasks without code
- ❌ NO completion without working evidence

## Step 0.3: Task Categorization

**TASKMASTER Structure**:

**Level 1: EPICS** (Major components)
- Epic 1: Complete 6-Level Neo4j Schema Implementation
- Epic 2: Deploy Remaining 11 CISA Sectors
- Epic 3: Build Psychohistory Prediction Engine
- Epic 4: Integrate NER10 Training Pipeline
- Epic 5: Create Production Deployment Infrastructure

**Level 2: FEATURES** (Epic breakdown)
- Feature 1.1: Equipment Taxonomy Nodes (Level 0)
- Feature 1.2: Equipment Instance Management (Level 1)
- Feature 1.3: SBOM Integration Pipeline (Level 2)
- ... (all 6 levels × all epics)

**Level 3: TASKS** (Actionable work items)
- Task: Deploy EquipmentProduct nodes to Neo4j
- Task: Create INSTANCE_OF relationships
- Task: Build SBOM parser for CycloneDX format
- ... (100+ specific tasks)

**Level 4: VALIDATION CRITERIA** (Evidence requirements)
- Validation: Cypher query returns correct count
- Validation: Unit tests pass
- Validation: Integration tests pass
- Validation: Performance benchmarks met

## Step 0.4: Neural Pattern Selection

**Applicable Patterns**:
- **CRITICAL THINKING**: Ensure tasks are REAL (not theatre)
- **SYSTEMS THINKING**: Task dependencies and integration
- **CONVERGENT**: Task completion criteria
- **VALIDATION**: Evidence-based assessment

**Learning Opportunities**:
- Pattern: "effective-taskmaster-structure"
- Pattern: "anti-development-theatre"
- Pattern: "evidence-based-validation"
