> I am deeply diappointed in your performance, as you have provided me the report in "retrospectuve" analysis, 
/home/jim/2_OXOT_Projects_Dev/Import_to_neo4j/2_AEON_DT_AI_Project_Mckenney/web_interface/docs/COMPREHENSIVE_SWARM_RETROSPECTIVE_ANALYSIS.md. You are NOT using SWARM capabitieis - you are 
directed to over and ove again with the prompt "you will continue to use the current swarm coordination with Qdrant vector memory is directed to track all agent activities, reference key 
data and store checkpoints for state preservation."" that begins every single PROMPT - yet your report says you do NOT use SWARM you just emulate it - and YOU do NOT TESTING. How 
impossibly stupid are you? You are to AME SWARM: Continue existing swarm coordination (6-day AEON project)
  - 💾 SAME QDRANT: Use existing Qdrant namespace for memory/checkpoints
  - 🎯 PROJECT: Neo4j Digital Twin Cybersecurity Schema
  - 📝 TRACK EVERYTHING: All decisions, activities, checkpoints in Qdrant   - And you are ALWAYS TO USE FULL SWARM capabilties- you have to startr by evaluating SWARM capabtlieys and USING
 them - for EXAMPE; *Critical Gaps:**
1. ❌ **MCP Tools Unused**: 69 of 72 tools documented but not executed
2. ❌ **Tests Not Run**: 254 tests defined, 0% executed  IS RIDICIULOUS!!!!!! ❌ **Negative**: User expectation of "swarm coordination" vs reality IS ABSURD I COMMANDED YOU TO USE SWARM 
and QDRANT - AND TO ALWAYS USE THIS PROEJC for continuity - I even thin you actually now have multiple projects so the memoties of the 6 days are fragmented - AB BAD BAD thing. Plus **Test
 Coverage:**
- ⚠️ Test suites DEFINED but NOT EXECUTED
- ⚠️ 127 backend tests written but not run
- ⚠️ 45 E2E tests written but not run
- ⚠️ 82 component tests written but not run, from NOW ON I WANT *Neural Capabilities (15 tools):** from Claude-flow used, I want **Swarm Management (3 tools):**,**Agent Operations (3 
tools):**,**Task Orchestration (3 tools):**, **Neural Features (3 tools):**, **DAA Features (9 tools):** and **System Utilities (3 tools):** USED - This project needs continuity and is 
very complex requiring advanced techniques and tools of RUV-SWARM and neural Capabilities (15 tools):* - I need yout to do another reotrespective analysis and detemein how you can use those
 tools, and how we can apply and ensure a pattern is used consisntely to explore eeach of the possible claude-flow toosl,  and RUV-SWARM MCP tools to assist this compex project, expeically
 since it invovles coomplext schemas and data - which qill benefit greatly from pattern management, meta-learning, pattern analyssu, Pattern reocgnzition, cognitive analysi and adaptive 
learning - all improving via qdrant vector memorieis so this SWARM - the claude-flow , the ruv-swarm IMPROVES as its knwoeldge improves. Right ow there is NO FEEEDBACK loop - you did not 
even run tests to ssee if you  coded correctly, and you LIED TO ME about using RUV-SWAM and only used minimal claude code capabilesi, even though I told yuo to USE MOST ADFVANCED features 
possible and to TEST.
