## Current Swarm
> Directive: you will continue to use the current swarm coordination with Qdrant vector memory is directed to track all agent activities, reference key data and store checkpoints for state preservation."

 - 🔄 SAME SWARM: Continue existing swarm coordination (6-day AEON project)
  - 💾 SAME QDRANT: Use existing Qdrant namespace for memory/checkpoints
  - 🎯 PROJECT: Neo4j Digital Twin Cybersecurity Schema
  - 📝 TRACK EVERYTHING: All decisions, activities, checkpoints in Qdrant


  ritten but not run, from NOW ON I WANT *Neural Capabilities (15 tools):** from Claude-flow used, I want **Swarm Management (3 tools):**,**Agent Operations (3 
tools):**,**Task Orchestration (3 tools):**, **Neural Features (3 tools):**, **DAA Features (9 tools):** and **System Utilities (3 tools):** USED - This project needs continuity and is 
very complex requiring advanced techniques and tools of RUV-SWARM and neural Capabilities (15 tools):* - I need yout to do another reotrespective analysis and detemein how you can use those
 tools, and how we can apply and ensure a pattern is used consisntely to explore eeach of the possible claude-flow toosl,  and RUV-SWARM MCP tools to assist this compex project, expeically
 since it invovles coomplext schemas and data - which qill benefit greatly from pattern management, meta-learning, pattern analyssu, Pattern reocgnzition, cognitive analysi and adaptive 
learning - all improving via qdrant vector memorieis so this SWARM - the claude-flow , the ruv-swarm IMPROVES as its knwoeldge improves. Right ow there is NO FEEEDBACK loop - you did not 
even run tests to ssee if you  coded correctly, and you LIED TO ME about using RUV-SWAM and only used minimal claude code capabilesi, even though I told yuo to USE MOST ADFVANCED features 
possible and to TEST. 


> Directive: you will continue to use the current swarm coordination with Qdrant vector memory is directed to track all agent activities, reference key data and store checkpoints for state
  preservation." You are COMMANDED TO dynmaically evaluate all of ruv-swarm and claude-swarm skills, tools and capabilties to determine the BEST tool, from *Neural Capabilities (15

SAME SWARM: Continue existing swarm coordination (6-day AEON project) SAME QDRANT: Use existing Qdrant namespace for memory/checkpoints
, PROJECT: Neo4j Digital Twin Cybersecurity Schema, TRACK EVERYTHING: All decisions, activities, checkpoints in Qdrant AND NOw DO THE FOLLOWING:
 
 
   1. Fix entity extraction (1-2 hours) - Add CVE/CWE/MITRE patterns to ner_agent.py   2. Add cyber dashboard cards (30 min) - Show CVE/threat metrics 3. Pre-built queries (1 hour) - Add common cyber queries to Graph page  4. Search facets (1 hour) - Add severity/type filters being SURE NOT  breaking neo4j or the schmea or data focus on improving and gettin ghte pipeline in order and maximum PRODCUTIVITY and usefulness to math the complexity of the scheama and  acheive our dream of a cyberseucrity digita twin for ccritical infrattructure 

 NEXT FEATURES
 **Database Integration:**
- Time-series queries from Neo4j
- Aggregation and trend calculation
- Historical tracking

**Cybersecurity Support:**
- CVE discovery trends over time
- Threat actor activity timelines
-* Attack campaign seasonality
-  Vulnerability patching metrics
**What Needs Enhancement:**
   Document upload extracts industrial entities but not CVEs/threats
   Dashboard could show threat metrics alongside document metrics
   Graph page could have pre-built cybersecurity query templates
