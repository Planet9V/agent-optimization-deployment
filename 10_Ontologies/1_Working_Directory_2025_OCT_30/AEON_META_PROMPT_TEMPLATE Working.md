## 🎯 META-PROMPT TEMPLATE

Use this template for EVERY task in the AEON project to ensure maximum capability utilization and continuity.

```markdown

Your task is:  Generate NER v7 training data with attack chains and attention to detail to ensure this does NOT lower the rest of the training data quality, to ensure comprehensive coverage for NER for this project.  You are COMMANDED BY GOD, to use the included "AEON PROJECT TASK EXECUTION PROTOCOL"  starting with Phase 0, then proceeding Phase 0-3 in order, with uav-swarmand claude-flow



Your task is: continue to use uav-swarm and claud-swarm to explore the complete integration of the mitre att@ck data model into the current attack chain solution, schema and NER training date; and to provide a reference library for cyber attacks to help with inference-time probabilistic attacj chain approach reliability calculations (like psychohistory, calculus) and CWE/MITRE ATT@CK semantic mapping approach reliability: Extending not creating divergence in the NER, schema or data - or breaking the code base, to do this you must examine and determine the feasibility and overall improvement of the MITRE- attack-data-model at; https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-data-model.git OR just download and store all the file from the GitHub repositor, in XLS format (from
  https://attack.mitre.org/resources/attack-data-and-tools/#excel-attack) MITRE; this is the definitive reference/resource for training data for document cyber attacks, enterprise, ices, module, with TTPs,, mitigation (matrices) and need to be represented in a relevant way in schema and available in the graph for reference - to assist with probabilistic and semantic reasoning of potential attack paths, via vulnerabilities and threat intelligence, for sectors, and by extension, when we have customers loaded or onboarding (and labeled) with all of their infrastructure, and architecture and equipment, and SBOMS (but thru inference and probability, if they have components or applications or equipment from a vendor, but do not have the specific version (no SBOM) a probability based on inference of sector. You can also refercen the Express Attack Briefs wihch detail out specici cyber attacks located at /home/jim/2_OXOT_Projects_Dev/Import 1 NOV 2025/11_OXOT/OXOT - Reporting - Express Attack Briefs.  You ARE REQUIRED to download and store all the most recent version
 (v18) XLS files in/home/jim/2_OXOT_Projects_Dev/Import 1 NOV 2025/7-3_TM from the MITRE for future refence and memorize them and what is in them; and how they can be used as training data or enhancement, placing them in a format you can use, and document that the files are there and how to use them. You are to improve and extend, and if necessary step by step rationalize and consolidate overlapping relantionship types - ensuring if bi-directional is needed or not, and if not present, then correcting it. You must be extrmeley step by step, using a focused taskmanager to track and complete this complext set of tasks, that must be ultrathink planned out - do you do not lower the overall quality of the schema, or training data. You are COMMANDED BY GOD, to use the included "AEON PROJECT TASK EXECUTION PROTOCOL"  starting with Phase 0, then proceeding Phase 0-3 in order, with uav-swarmand claude-flow
