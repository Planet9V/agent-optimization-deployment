- **Information Technology:** Functions-based structure (6 critical functions) rather than geographic/facility-based

### The "335 Subsector" Claim

Various sources have claimed 335+ subsectors exist within the 16 critical infrastructure sectors. This research found:

- **49 formally designated subsectors** with clear CISA/agency recognition
- **30+ functional categories** for sectors without traditional subsectors (Dams, DIB, IT)
- **~79 total high-level categories**

The 335+ figure likely includes:
- All sub-categories and facility types within each subsector
- Detailed breakdowns (e.g., Transportation's 150-185 facility/vehicle types)
- Industry classifications beyond official CISA designations
- State-level or regional variations
