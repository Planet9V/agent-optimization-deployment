## Executive Summary

The United States officially recognizes **16 Critical Infrastructure Sectors** as defined by Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21) in 2013 and reaffirmed by National Security Memorandum (NSM-22) in April 2024. These sectors encompass assets, systems, and networks—whether physical or virtual—considered so vital that their incapacitation or destruction would have debilitating effects on national security, economic security, public health, or safety.

## Official Sector Count

**Total: 16 Critical Infrastructure Sectors**

This count has remained consistent since PPD-21 in 2013. Despite CISA recommending in 2022 that "space" and "bioeconomy" be added as new sectors, the 2024 National Security Memorandum reaffirmed the existing 16 sectors without expansion.

- **Established:** The 16 critical infrastructure sectors and assigned Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs), later renamed Sector Risk Management Agencies (SRMAs)
- **Framework:** Implemented through sector and cross-sector partnership structures described in the 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP)

### 2018: CISA Establishment
- The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) was established under the Department of Homeland Security
- Represented a significant strengthening of the previous National Programs and Policy Directorate (NPPD)
- **Note:** PPD-21 pre-dates the establishment of CISA

### 2019: National Critical Functions Framework
- CISA published a set of **55 critical functions** of government and the private sector considered vital to national security, economy, and public health
- Intended to better assess how failures in key systems, assets, components, and technologies may cascade across the 16 critical infrastructure sectors
- Provides a complementary analysis layer to the sector-based approach

### 2022: Rejected Sector Expansion Recommendations
- CISA recommended adding **"space"** and **"bioeconomy"** as new critical infrastructure sectors
- Recommendation was not adopted in the subsequent policy update

### 2024: National Security Memorandum (NSM-22)
- **Issued:** April 30, 2024
- **Status:** Evolution of PPD-21, representing the first major update since 2013
