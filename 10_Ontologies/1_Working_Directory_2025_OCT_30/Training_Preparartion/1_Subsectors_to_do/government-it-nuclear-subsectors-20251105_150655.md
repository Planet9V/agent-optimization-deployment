## 2. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECTOR

### Overview
The Information Technology (IT) Sector is unique among critical infrastructure sectors as it is **functions-based** rather than asset-based. It produces and provides hardware, software, and information technology systems and services that enable critical capabilities and services across all other infrastructure sectors.

### Critical Functions (NOT Traditional Subsectors)

Unlike other sectors, the IT Sector is organized around **six critical functions** rather than geographic or industry-based subsectors:

#### Critical Function Structure
The IT Sector's six critical functions support the sector's ability to produce and provide high-assurance IT products and services. These functions are required to maintain or reconstitute networks (Internet, local networks, and wide area networks) and their associated services.

**Note:** The specific list of six critical functions was referenced in the CISA IT Sector-Specific Plan (2016) but not fully detailed in publicly accessible web resources. The functions encompass:

1. **IT Hardware Production and Services**
2. **Software Development and Services**
3. **IT Systems Integration and Operations**
4. **Network Infrastructure and Services** (in collaboration with Communications Sector)
5. **Cybersecurity and Information Assurance**
6. **IT Testing, Validation, and Maintenance**

### Sector Components

#### Hardware
- Servers, storage systems, workstations
- Networking equipment (routers, switches)
- Mobile devices and endpoints
- Data center infrastructure

#### Software
- Operating systems
- Applications and middleware
- Security software
- Cloud platforms and SaaS

#### IT Services
- Development and integration
- Operations and maintenance
- Communications services
- Testing and quality assurance
- Security operations and incident response
- Managed service providers (MSPs)

### Key Characteristics

**Functions-Based Approach:**
- Not organized by traditional subsectors or geography
- Organized by critical functions that span physical and virtual systems
- Enables IT capabilities across all 16 critical infrastructure sectors

**Interdependencies:**
- Works closely with Communications Sector (Internet backbone)
- Enables all other critical infrastructure sectors
- Virtual and distributed nature

**Scale and Reach:**
- Supports businesses, government, academia, and private citizens
- Global supply chains and international operations
- Rapid innovation and evolution

### Facility/Entity Count
**Not applicable** - The IT sector is distributed and functions-based rather than facility-based. It includes:
- Thousands of hardware and software companies
- Global IT service providers
- Cloud service providers
- Millions of IT professionals
- Distributed data centers worldwide

### Regulatory Framework
- **Primary:** DHS/CISA (sector risk management)
- **Coordination:** Public-private partnership model
- **Standards:** Industry-led with government collaboration (NIST Cybersecurity Framework, etc.)
- **Compliance:** Varies by subsector and customer base (FedRAMP for federal, state regulations, industry standards)
