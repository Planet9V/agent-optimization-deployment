## Research Methodology

### Search Strategy:
1. Comprehensive web searches for each sector using multiple query patterns
2. Direct access to CISA official documentation and sector-specific plans
3. Cross-referencing multiple authoritative sources
4. Verification against government agency documentation

### Query Patterns Used:
- "CISA [SECTOR NAME] subsectors list"
- "[SECTOR NAME] sector specific plan subsectors"
- "Critical infrastructure [SECTOR] subsector classification"
- "NIPP [SECTOR] sector subsectors"

### Data Quality Assessment:
- **High Confidence (Formally Designated):** Commercial Facilities (8), Communications (5), Critical Manufacturing (4), Emergency Services (5), Energy (2), Transportation Systems (7), Water and Wastewater (2)
- **Medium Confidence (Documented but not formally coordinated):** Chemical (4), Financial Services (4), Government Facilities (3), Nuclear (3), Food and Agriculture (2)
- **Lower Confidence (Functional areas, not formal subsectors):** Dams, Defense Industrial Base, Healthcare and Public Health, Information Technology

### Limitations:
1. Some sectors do not have formally designated subsectors with separate coordinating councils
2. Defense Industrial Base subsector structure is not publicly enumerated in detail
3. Healthcare and Public Health subsector taxonomy varies by source
4. Information Technology sector integrates closely with Communications but lacks distinct subsector designations

## Conclusion

This research provides the most comprehensive publicly available breakdown of US critical infrastructure subsectors based on official CISA documentation and government sources. The 16 sectors contain at least 37 clearly designated subsectors, with additional functional subdivisions bringing the total closer to 50+ distinct areas of critical infrastructure.

The subsector structure reflects both functional organization (how services are delivered) and coordination requirements (how public-private partnerships are organized). Some sectors have evolved more granular subsector structures than others, particularly those with diverse industry participants like Commercial Facilities and Transportation Systems.

**Research Complete:** November 5, 2025
