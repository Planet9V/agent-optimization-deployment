Rotation rate accuracy critical for Doppler velocity dealiasing: maximum unambiguous velocity V_max = λ × PRF / 4 = 0.1m × 320 Hz / 4 = 8.0 m/s (PRF 320 Hz pulse repetition frequency chosen preventing range folding from 230 km maximum range requiring PRF <650 Hz), velocity folding occurring at ±8 m/s limits requiring dual-PRF technique for severe weather detection where wind speeds exceed unambiguous velocity threshold. Azimuth encoder calibration uses Encoder_Test_Set comparing antenna position indication to optical reference targets positioned at known azimuths 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees: maximum error 0.08 degrees (specification <0.2 degrees ensuring accurate storm cell positioning for warning issuance).
