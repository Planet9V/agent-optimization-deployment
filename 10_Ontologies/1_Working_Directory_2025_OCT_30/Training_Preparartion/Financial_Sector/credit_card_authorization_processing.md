# Credit Card Authorization Processing Operations

## Overview
Credit card authorization systems process real-time transaction approval requests from merchants, validating cardholder account status, available credit, and fraud risk within milliseconds to enable seamless payment experiences while protecting issuers from losses due to fraud and credit risk.

## Operational Procedures

### 1. Authorization Request Receipt and Parsing
- **ISO 8583 Message Format**: Authorization requests arrive as ISO 8583 formatted messages containing card number, amount, merchant details, and transaction metadata
- **EMV Chip Data Processing**: Chip transactions include cryptograms (ARQC) generated by card chip and validated by issuer HSM for counterfeit prevention
- **Contactless Transaction Handling**: NFC transactions under contactless limit (typically $100-250) may bypass PIN/signature requirements for faster checkout
- **E-Commerce CVV Verification**: Card-not-present transactions validated against 3-digit CVV code and AVS (Address Verification System) match

### 2. Account Status and Balance Verification
- **Card Active Status Check**: System verifies card not canceled, expired, reported lost/stolen, or placed in block status due to fraud investigation
- **Credit Limit Retrieval**: Current credit limit minus outstanding balance and pending authorizations calculates available credit for approval decision
- **Overlimit Authorization**: Some issuers approve transactions exceeding credit limit subject to overlimit fees and account-level opt-in settings
- **Cash Advance vs. Purchase Classification**: Merchant Category Code (MCC) determines if transaction treated as purchase or cash advance with different limits/fees

### 3. Fraud Scoring and Risk Assessment
- **Real-Time Fraud Model Scoring**: Machine learning models assign 0-999 fraud risk score based on transaction characteristics and cardholder behavior
- **Velocity Checking**: System validates transaction count and dollar amount within rolling time windows (hourly, daily, weekly) against normal patterns
- **Geographic Risk Factors**: Cross-border transactions and high-risk countries receive elevated scrutiny and may require additional verification
- **Stand-In Processing Logic**: If fraud scoring system unavailable, simplified rules-based approval logic ensures transaction processing continuity

### 4. Authorization Decision Rendering
- **Approval (00 Response Code)**: Transaction approved; available credit reduced immediately to prevent overlimit exposure during posting delay
- **Decline Codes**: Specific decline reasons (insufficient funds 51, pick up card 04, call issuer 01) guide merchant and cardholder next actions
- **Referral Code (01)**: Transactions requiring manual review route to authorization call center for voice verification with cardholder
- **Partial Approval**: Gas stations and other merchants may receive approval for less than requested amount if available credit insufficient

### 5. Authorization Hold and Settlement
- **Authorization Lifespan**: Approved transactions create holds on available credit lasting 3-7 days pending settlement from merchant
- **Settlement Matching**: Clearing files from merchant acquirers matched to authorization records; mismatches investigated as potential fraud or merchant error
- **Authorization Expiration**: Unsettled authorizations automatically release after expiration period, restoring available credit to cardholder
- **Incremental Authorizations**: Hotels and car rentals submit initial authorization followed by incremental increases as estimated charges grow

### 6. Chargeback and Dispute Processing
- **Cardholder Dispute Intake**: Customers dispute unauthorized or erroneous transactions via online banking, mobile app, or customer service call
- **Provisional Credit Issuance**: Regulation Z requires provisional credit within 2 billing cycles (max 90 days) while investigating dispute
- **Merchant Rebuttal Process**: Issuers send chargeback to merchant acquirer with reason code; merchant may accept or contest with supporting documentation
- **Arbitration and Final Determination**: Unresolved disputes escalated to card network arbitration; final decision binding on issuer and merchant

### 7. Decline Recovery and Authorization Optimization
- **Account Updater Services**: Visa Account Updater and Mastercard Automatic Billing Updater provide merchants with new card numbers for recurring billing
- **Decline Codes Analysis**: Trends in decline reasons (expired cards, insufficient credit) identify opportunities for credit line increases or card renewal campaigns
- **Authorization Routing Optimization**: Issuers test different authorization parameters (approval thresholds, fraud model versions) to optimize approval rates vs. fraud losses
- **Real-Time Decisioning Tuning**: Weekly model updates incorporate latest fraud trends and false positive feedback from cardholder verification calls

## System Integration Points

### Core Banking and Account Management
- **Real-Time Balance Updates**: Authorization approvals immediately reduce available credit; settlement posting updates ledger balance 1-3 days later
- **Statement Generation**: Settled transactions appear on monthly billing statements with merchant name, transaction date, and posted amount
- **Minimum Payment Calculation**: Core system calculates minimum payment based on statement balance, new charges, and regulatory requirements (typically 1-3% of balance)

### Fraud Detection Platforms
- **Pre-Authorization Fraud Scoring**: Transactions scored for fraud risk before authorization decision; high-risk transactions declined or sent to verification
- **Post-Authorization Monitoring**: Approved transactions undergo additional screening; suspected fraud triggers automated card blocks and customer alerts
- **Neural Network Models**: Deep learning algorithms trained on historical fraud patterns achieve >90% fraud detection rates with <5% false positive rates

- **Google Pay DPAN Generation**: Device-specific Primary Account Numbers (DPAN) generated and linked to physical card for contactless payments
- **Samsung Pay MST Technology**: Magnetic Secure Transmission emulates magnetic stripe swipe for compatibility with legacy terminals
- **Token Lifecycle Management**: Lost/stolen device token deactivation without canceling underlying card; tokens automatically updated when card reissued

## Regulatory Compliance

### Regulation Z - Truth in Lending Act
- **Billing Error Rights**: Cardholders have 60 days from statement date to dispute transactions; issuers must investigate and respond within 2 billing cycles
- **Liability Limits**: Consumer liability for unauthorized charges limited to $50; industry practice typically provides zero liability protection
