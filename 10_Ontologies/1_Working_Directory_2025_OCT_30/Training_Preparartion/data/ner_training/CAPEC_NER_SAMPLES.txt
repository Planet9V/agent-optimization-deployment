CAPEC: 113 - Interface Manipulation
Abstraction: Meta
Context: description
Entity Count: 2

TEXT:
An adversary manipulates the use or processing of an interface (e.g. Application Programming Interface (API) or System-on-Chip (SoC)) resulting in an adverse impact upon the security of the system implementing the interface. This can allow the adversary to bypass access control and/or execute functionality not intended by the interface implementation, possibly compromising the system which integrates the interface. Interface manipulation can take on a number of forms including forcing the unexpe...

Abstraction: Meta
Context: description
Entity Count: 5

CAPEC: 1 - Accessing Functionality Not Properly Constrained by ACLs
Abstraction: Standard
Context: description
Entity Count: 18

TEXT:
In applications, particularly web applications, access to functionality is mitigated by an authorization framework. This framework maps Access Control Lists (ACLs) to elements of the application's functionality; particularly URL's for web apps. In the case that the administrator failed to specify an ACL for a particular element, an attacker may be able to access it with impunity. An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained by ACLs can obtain sensitive informatio...

CAPEC: 10 - Buffer Overflow via Environment Variables
Abstraction: Detailed
Context: description

CAPEC: 100 - Overflow Buffers
Abstraction: Standard
Context: description
Entity Count: 9

TEXT:
Buffer Overflow attacks target improper or missing bounds checking on buffer operations, typically triggered by input injected by an adversary. As a consequence, an adversary is able to write past the boundaries of allocated buffer regions in memory, causing a program crash or potentially redirection of execution as per the adversaries' choice.

SAMPLE 18
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAPEC: 100 - Overflow Buffers
Abstraction: Standard
Context: example_instance
Entity Count: 9

TEXT:
The most straightforward example is an application that reads in input from the user and stores it in an internal buffer but does not check that the size of the input data is less than or equal to the size of the buffer. If the user enters excessive length data, the buffer may overflow leading to the application crashing, or worse, enabling the user to cause execution of injected code.

CAPEC: 100 - Overflow Buffers
Abstraction: Standard
Context: example_instance
Entity Count: 9

TEXT:
Many web servers enforce security in web applications through the use of filter plugins. An example is the SiteMinder plugin used for authentication. An overflow in such a plugin, possibly through a long URL or redirect parameter, can allow an adversary not only to bypass the security checks but also execute arbitrary code on the target web server in the context of the user that runs the web server process.

CAPEC: 101 - Server Side Include (SSI) Injection
Abstraction: Detailed
Context: description
Entity Count: 6

TEXT:
An attacker can use Server Side Include (SSI) Injection to send code to a web application that then gets executed by the web server. Doing so enables the attacker to achieve similar results to Cross Site Scripting, viz., arbitrary code execution and information disclosure, albeit on a more limited scale, since the SSI directives are nowhere near as powerful as a full-fledged scripting language. Nonetheless, the attacker can conveniently gain access to sensitive files, such as password files, and...
