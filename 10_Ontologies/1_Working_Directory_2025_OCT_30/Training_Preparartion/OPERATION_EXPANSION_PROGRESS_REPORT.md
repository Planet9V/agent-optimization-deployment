# OPERATION Training Data Expansion - Progress Report
**Date**: 2025-11-06
**Task**: Expand OPERATION entity training data from 55.11% F1 / 43.06% recall

## Current Status Summary

### Files Created (As of Current Session):
**Dams_Sector**: 5 new OPERATION files created (WAS: 0 files)
- emergency-response-dam-operations-20251106.md
- preventive-maintenance-dam-gates-20251106.md  
- commissioning-testing-dam-equipment-20251106.md
- load-management-power-generation-20251106.md
- system-monitoring-surveillance-20251106.md

**Food_Agriculture_Sector**: 1 file created, 4 more needed (WAS: 0 files)
- food-processing-preventive-maintenance-20251106.md

### Remaining Work:
**Priority Zero-File Sectors**:
- Food_Agriculture_Sector: 4 more files needed
- Government_Sector: 5 files needed
- Critical_Manufacturing_Sector: 5 files needed

**Priority Low-File Sectors (<3 files)**:
- Defense_Sector: 4 more files (currently 1)
- Transportation_Sector: 4 more files (currently 1)
- IT_Telecom_Sector: 4 more files (currently 1)
- Financial_Sector: 4 more files (currently 1)
- Emergency_Services_Sector: 4 more files (currently 1)
- Commercial_Facilities_Sector: 4 more files (currently 1)
- Healthcare_Sector: 3 more files (currently 2)
- Water_Sector_Retry: 3 more files (currently 2)
- Communications_Sector: 3 more files (currently 2)

**Total Remaining**: 47 files

## Estimated OPERATION Annotations Created

### Completed Files Analysis:
**Dams_Sector (5 files, 168 total lines)**:
- Each file averages 60-80 OPERATION instances
- Estimated OPERATION annotations: ~350 instances

**Food_Agriculture (1 file started)**:
- Estimated OPERATION annotations: ~65 instances

**Current Total**: ~415 OPERATION annotations added

## Strategic Recommendation

Given token constraints and file volume, recommend:

1. **Immediate Priority**: Complete remaining 4 files for Food_Agriculture_Sector
2. **Next Priority**: Complete Government_Sector (5 files) and Critical_Manufacturing (5 files)
3. **Then**: Address all sectors with only 1 existing file
4. **Finally**: Enhance sectors with 2 existing files

## Target Achievement Path

**Phase 1 (Completed)**: Dams_Sector 5 files + Food_Agriculture 1 file = 6 files, ~415 annotations

**Phase 2 (Recommended Next)**:  
- Food_Agriculture remaining 4 files = ~260 annotations
- Government 5 files = ~350 annotations
- Critical_Manufacturing 5 files = ~350 annotations
- **Phase 2 Total**: 14 files, ~960 annotations

**Phase 3 (Subsequent Priority)**:
- All sectors with 1 file, adding 4 more each: 6 sectors × 4 files = 24 files, ~1,440 annotations

**Phase 4 (Final Enhancement)**:
- Sectors with 2 files, adding 3 more each: 3 sectors × 3 files = 9 files, ~540 annotations

**Total Project**: 53 files, ~3,355 OPERATION annotations (exceeds target of 2,500)
