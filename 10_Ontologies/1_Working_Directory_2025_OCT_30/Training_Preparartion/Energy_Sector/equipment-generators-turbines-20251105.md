## Technical Specifications

Generator protection systems deploy Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories SEL-300G with 87G differential protection, 32 directional power relay, and 59 overvoltage elements. Basler Electric DECS-400 digital excitation control maintains ±0.25% voltage regulation with power system stabilizer functionality. Woodward 505E governor control provides droop and isochronous modes with load sharing capability for multi-unit plants. ABB Ability System 800xA integrates turbine control, generator protection, and auxiliary systems through IEC 61850 communication.

Combustion turbine monitoring includes Bently Nevada 3500/42M proximity probes measuring shaft vibration at bearing locations with 200 mV/mil sensitivity. Baker Hughes Panametrics moisture analyzer monitors steam purity at parts-per-billion detection levels preventing turbine blade erosion. Emerson CSI 6500 machinery health monitor provides continuous vibration analysis with automated diagnostic alarms. Metso DNA automation system coordinates boiler, turbine, and balance-of-plant control with model predictive control algorithms.

## Operational Characteristics

Combined cycle power plants achieve 62% net efficiency through triple-pressure reheat heat recovery steam generator configurations. Gas turbine inlet air cooling reduces heat rate by 15% during summer peak demand using evaporative or chiller-based systems. Steam turbine bypass systems enable rapid load changes with 5% per minute ramp rates while maintaining stable steam conditions. Black start capability requires diesel-driven emergency generators at 4-8 MW capacity for plant auxiliary power restoration.

Turbine blade inspection employs borescope technology with articulating probes detecting 0.1 mm crack indications in hot gas path components. Vibration analysis identifies bearing wear, shaft misalignment, and blade imbalance through spectral analysis and trending algorithms. Generator stator winding testing uses partial discharge measurement at elevated voltage detecting insulation degradation before failure. Rotor dynamic balancing maintains vibration below 25 micrometers peak-to-peak during normal operation preventing bearing damage.

## Integration Architecture

Power plant distributed control systems connect turbine control, generator protection, and electrical switchyard through redundant fiber optic networks. OPC UA servers provide secure data exchange between turbine control and enterprise asset management systems. IEC 61850 GOOSE messaging enables millisecond-speed interlocking between generator protection relays and circuit breaker controls. Historian systems archive operational data at one-second intervals supporting performance analysis and predictive maintenance algorithms.
