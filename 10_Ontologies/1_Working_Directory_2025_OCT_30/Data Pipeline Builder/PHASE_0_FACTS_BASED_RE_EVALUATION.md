## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**User Challenge:** Claims made in previous reports may not match reality.

**Specific Issues Raised:**
1. ❓ **Redis:** "We have no redis" - yet architecture claims Redis/BullMQ implementation
2. ❓ **Testing:** Did tests actually run? Or were results claimed without execution?
3. ❓ **Dependencies:** Were Python packages actually installed and tested?
4. ❓ **NER/spaCy:** Was relationship extraction actually tested with real data?
5. ❓ **Processing Model:** User requires SERIAL processing, not parallel document processing
6. ❓ **Architecture:** Documentation may describe non-existent Redis architecture

**Action Required:** FACTS-BASED re-evaluation of all claims
