# Vulnerability Intelligence - VulnCheck Docs


Vulnerability Intelligence - VulnCheck Docs](https://docs.vulncheck.com/products/exploit-and-vulnerability-intelligence/vulnerability-intelligence)

## Summary

> VulnCheck's Vulnerability Intelligence service offers comprehensive vulnerability data, including enrichment, CPE, CVSS scores, and exploit intelligence, surpassing NIST NVD data. It covers a wider range of vulnerabilities, including those in open-source packages and ICS/OT devices, and provides unique fields like categorization, faster CPE, CVSS temporal enrichment, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and more. The service can be accessed via the VulnCheck API to download the vulncheck-nvd2 index or individual CVE records.

## Key Points

- VulnCheck Vulnerability Intelligence provides vulnerability enrichment, CPE Enrichment, CVSS temporal scores, and rich exploit intelligence.
- Unlike other vulnerability databases, VulnCheck includes information on vulnerabilities in Open Source packages and ICS/OT, IoMT, IoT, mobile devices.
- VulnCheck Exploit & Vulnerability Intelligence includes unique fields such as categorization, faster CPE, CVSS Temporal Enrichment, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and EPSS Enrichment.
- The VulnCheck API facilitates downloading VulnCheck Vulnerability Intelligence and accessing individual CVE records.

### Key Concepts

*   **Vulnerability Intelligence**: Comprehensive data on vulnerabilities, including enrichment, CPE, CVSS, and exploit intelligence.
*   **Exploit Intelligence**: Information on known exploits for vulnerabilities.
*   **CPE (Common Platform Enumeration)**: A standardized method of describing and identifying classes of applications, operating systems, and hardware devices present among an enterprise's computing assets.
*   **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)**: A standardized approach for rating the severity of software vulnerabilities.
*   **MITRE ATT&CK**: A knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.
*   **MITRE CAPEC**: A comprehensive catalog of common attack patterns.
*   **CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)**: A community-developed list of common software and hardware weaknesses.
*   **EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System)**: A data-driven system for estimating the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited.
*   **Package URL (purl)**: A standardized way to identify and locate software packages.
*   **SSVC (Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization)**: A decision-making framework to categorize vulnerabilities based on specific organizational needs and context.

Exploit & Vulnerability Intelligence

## Vulnerability Intelligence

Leverage the vulnerability intelligence features within VulnCheck Exploit & Vulnerability Intelligence to get the industry's fastest and most comprehensive vulnerability intelligence available and solve the vulnerability prioritization challenge today.

VulnCheck Vulnerability Intelligence service provides vulnerability enrichment, CPE Enrichment, CVSS temporal scores, vulnerability categorization data, and embeds rich exploit intelligence to go well above and beyond what the NIST NVD provides.

VulnCheck Vulnerability Intelligence is an autonomous system that tracks hundreds of vendor and government advisories, and then marries that data with best-in-class exploit intelligence from VulnCheck.

Unlike other vulnerability databases, VulnCheck includes the latest information on a wider range of vulnerabilities, including:

- Vulnerabilities in Open Source packages / dependencies
- Vulnerabilities in ICS/OT, IoMT, IoT, mobile, etc., devices

VulnCheck Exploit & Vulnerability Intelligence also includes unique fields, typically unavailable in other alternative sources, such as:

- Categorization (e.g., ICS/OT, IoMT, IoT, Mobile, Server Software, etc.)
- Faster & Cleaner Common Platform Enumeration(CPE)
- CVSS Temporal Enrichment (CVSS-BT) / CVSS V4 Enrichment
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- MITRE Attack Patterns (CAPEC) mapping
- CWE associations for pre-2008 CVEs
- More vendor advisory references
- More vulnerability database references
- More exploit references
- Less broken links
- EPSS Enrichment
- Ability to query by Package URL (purl)
- Vulnerability Status

The VulnCheck API makes it easy to download VulnCheck Vulnerability Intelligence. To start, simply query the `vulncheck-nvd2` index via the \`/v3/backup/vulncheck-nvd2 API as follows:

The VulnCheck API makes it easy to get started with VulnCheck Exploit & Vulnerability Intelligence. To start, simply query the `vulncheck-nvd2` index via the `/v3/index/:index?cve=:cve` API as follows:

The above example searches the vulncheck-nvd2 index for information on CVE-2024-21762.

After calling the `/v3/index/vulncheck-nvd2?cve=:cve` API endpoint with a valid CVE identifier, a response similar to the below will be returned:
