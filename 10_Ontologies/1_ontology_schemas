Here are the **top ontology schemas** representing each of the four major domains — cybersecurity, IT networks, industrial control systems, and enterprise/business IT — along with their official links and a short description of each.

***

### **1. Cybersecurity Ontology**
**Name:** Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO)  
**Link:** [https://www.unifiedcyberontology.org/ontology/start.html](https://www.unifiedcyberontology.org/ontology/start.html)  
**Description:**  
UCO is a community-driven ontology providing a **semantic foundation for cybersecurity domains**, including threat intelligence, malware analysis, risk management, and incident response. It standardizes cyber information exchanges and enables interoperability across tools and platforms.[1]

***

### **2. Network Infrastructure Ontology**
**Name:** DevOps Infrastructure Ontology Network  
**Link:** [https://oeg-upm.github.io/devops-infra/index.html](https://oeg-upm.github.io/devops-infra/index.html)  
**Description:**  
Developed by the **Ontology Engineering Group (OEG)** and Huawei Research, this ontology suite models **network, hardware, software, data center, and certificate infrastructures** for IT and DevOps ecosystems. It includes sub-ontologies such as **Network Infrastructure, Server Infrastructure, Software, and Workflow** ontologies.[1]

### **3. Industrial Control System (ICS) Ontology**
**Name:** ICS Cybersecurity Ontology (NIST/CISA Framework)  
**Link:** [https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10327905](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10327905)  
**Description:**  
This ontology models **cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and ethical hacking methods** for industrial networks such as SCADA and PLC systems. Developed for research into ICS security, it connects system components, access vectors, and exploit taxonomies to enable intelligent ICS risk assessment.[2]

***

### **4. Enterprise / Business IT Ontology**
**Name:** Enterprise Architecture Ontology (EAO)  
**Link:** [https://www.capstera.com/enterprise-architecture-ontologies/](https://www.capstera.com/enterprise-architecture-ontologies/)  
**Description:**  
EAO defines and connects enterprise architecture elements — strategies, business processes, applications, information flows, and technology infrastructure. It supports **business-IT alignment**, modeling how strategic goals are operationalized across digital ecosystems.[3]

***

These four represent leading ontology frameworks across their respective domains — providing comprehensive, open, and semantically rich models for **cybersecurity integration**, **network representation**, **industrial system protection**, and **corporate IT alignment**.
