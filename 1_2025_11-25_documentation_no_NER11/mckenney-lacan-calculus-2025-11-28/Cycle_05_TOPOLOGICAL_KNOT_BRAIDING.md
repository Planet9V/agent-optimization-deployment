## 1. The Braid Group ($B_3$)

We model the Lacanian Registers as 3 strands in a braid.
*   **Strand 1**: The Real (R).
*   **Strand 2**: The Symbolic (S).
*   **Strand 3**: The Imaginary (I).

The Braid Group $B_3$ is generated by $\sigma_1$ (swap 1-2) and $\sigma_2$ (swap 2-3).

## 2. The Borromean Braid

The Borromean Knot (where no two rings are linked, but the three together are linked) corresponds to a specific word in the Braid Group.
$$ \beta = (\sigma_1 \sigma_2^{-1})^3 $$
*   **Significance**: This specific braiding pattern creates the "Resilient Structure" of the psyche.

## 3. The Algorithm (Python/KnotTheory)

```python
def calculate_jones_polynomial(braid_word):
    # Input: List of generators [1, -2, 1, -2, 1, -2]
    # Output: The Jones Polynomial V(t)
    
    # If V(t) == t + 1/t ... (Borromean)
    # Then Status = HEALTHY
    
    # If V(t) == 1 (Unknot)
    # Then Status = PSYCHOTIC (The knot has fallen apart)
    pass
```

## 4. The Innovation

By calculating the **Jones Polynomial** of the team's interaction log, we can mathematically prove whether the team is "Linked" (Resilient) or "Unlinked" (Fragile). We detect the *moment* the knot slips.
