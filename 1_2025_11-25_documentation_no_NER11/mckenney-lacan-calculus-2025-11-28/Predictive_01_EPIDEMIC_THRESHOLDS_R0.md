## 1. The Core Equation

$$ R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma} \times \lambda_{max}(A) $$

*   **$R_0$ (Basic Reproduction Number)**: The expected number of new infections generated by one infected node.
    *   If $R_0 > 1$: Epidemic (Exponential Growth).
    *   If $R_0 < 1$: Extinction (Die Out).

## 2. The Variables

### 2.1 Infection Rate ($\beta$)
The probability that an infected node infects a susceptible neighbor per unit time.
*   **Cyber Factors**: Vulnerability Severity (CVSS), Exploit Availability, User Click Rate.
*   **Control**: Hardening, WAF, Email Filtering.

### 2.2 Recovery Rate ($\gamma$)
The rate at which infected nodes are cured (patched/reimaged).
*   **Cyber Factors**: MTTR (Mean Time To Remediate), Patch Cycle Frequency.
*   **Control**: Automated Patching, Self-Healing Infrastructure.

### 2.3 Spectral Radius ($\lambda_{max}(A)$)
The largest eigenvalue of the Network Adjacency Matrix $A$.
*   **Cyber Factors**: Network Topology, Lateral Movement Paths, Active Directory Trust Relationships.
*   **Control**: Network Segmentation, Zero Trust (Micro-Segmentation).

## 3. Application: The "Kill Switch"

To stop an epidemic, we must drive $R_0 < 1$.
We have three levers:
1.  **Decrease $\beta$**: Disable the vulnerable service.
2.  **Increase $\gamma$**: Isolate and reimage hosts faster.
3.  **Decrease $\lambda_{max}$**: Sever network links (Segmentation).

### 3.1 The "Super-Spreader" Node
Nodes with high Eigenvector Centrality contribute disproportionately to $\lambda_{max}$.
*   **Strategy**: Prioritize patching "Hub" nodes (Domain Controllers, Jump Boxes) to collapse the spectral radius.

## 4. Conclusion

Malware spread is not random; it is a function of network topology and response time. By calculating $R_0$ in real-time, the AEON Digital Twin can predict an outbreak before it happens and automatically apply the optimal "Vaccine" (Segmentation or Patching).
