KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE SAFE ARCHIVAL: 7.5GB
- UNTRACKED_FILES_BACKUP/ (7.4GB) - Untracked, duplicate content
- Old Ontology Versions (149M) - Superseded by current version v2

CONDITIONAL ARCHIVAL: 7.4GB (requires verification)
- backups/ directory - Safe only after git history verification

DECISION POINTS HOLDING ARCHIVAL: 1.3GB+
- Training_Data_Check_to_see (120M) - Pending Agent 4 redundancy audit
- Import folders (1.3GB+) - Pending neo4j validation

ACTIVE RETENTION: 11.2GB (never archive)
- Main projects + training data + documentation: 2.8GB (critical)
- Dependencies (node_modules): 894M (rebuilt on demand)
- Tools & Documentation: 7.5GB (always keep)

ESTIMATED RESULT:
- Before: 26GB
- After Phase 1: 18.5GB (7.5GB freed)
- After Phase 1-3c: 11.1GB (14.9GB freed + node_modules rebuild)
