- Agent 48: Incident Documenter (CVE deduplication, sector mismatches)
- Agent 49: Compliance Auditor (ISO 27001, NERC CIP audit trails)
- Agent 50-55: Enhancement governance (E6 wiki truth, E11 psychohistory quality)
- Validator 11-12: Governance validation (verify metrics real, audit history accurate)

COORDINATION AGENTS (3):
- Master Coordinator: Orchestrate 5 teams, manage dependencies
- Memory Coordinator: Qdrant state management, progress tracking
- Quality Coordinator: Calculate scores, enforce 9/10 gates

TEST AGENTS (5):
- Content Tester: Verify completeness (all sections present)
- Accuracy Tester: Verify claims against evidence
- Example Tester: Run code examples, validate queries
- Integration Tester: Check cross-references work
- Quality Scorer: Calculate final 1-10 ratings

TEST-DRIVEN PROTOCOL (EVERY improvement):
1. Build improvement (agent creates content)
2. Test improvement (test agent validates)
3. Score improvement (quality scorer rates 1-10)
4. Gate check (must be ≥9.0 to proceed)
5. Commit improvement (git commit with evidence)
6. Store in Qdrant (memory coordination)
7. Next improvement (continue until all 20 done)

QUALITY GATES (4 gates):
- Gate 1: Each improvement ≥9.0/10 (20 gates, continuous)
- Gate 2: Category average ≥9.0/10 (5 gates, per category)
- Gate 3: Overall average ≥9.0/10 (1 gate, final)
- Gate 4: All tests passing (automated validation)

MCP & HOOKS:
- Sequential-thinking: Complex analysis, competitive research
- Context7: API standards, business frameworks
- Morphllm: Bulk documentation updates
- Qdrant: Memory coordination across 50 agents
- Pre-task: Validate inputs, load context
- Post-task: Run tests, calculate score, store memory
- Session: Checkpoint every 30 min, auto-recover

MEMORY KEYS (Qdrant):
- improvement-{category}-{number}-start
- improvement-{category}-{number}-complete
- improvement-{category}-{number}-score
- category-{name}-average
- overall-quality-score
- progress-checkpoint-{timestamp}

AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION:
- No user approval points
- Automated decision-making
- Self-healing (retry 3x on failure)
- Progressive enhancement (highest ROI first)
- Continuous validation (test every output)
- Final certification (all gates pass)

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✅ APIs: 8.2 → 9.0+ (4 improvements complete, tests pass)
✅ Levels: 8.4 → 9.0+ (3 improvements complete, queries validated)
✅ Business: 7.5 → 9.0+ (4 improvements complete, ROI verified)
✅ Implementation: 7.6 → 9.0+ (4 improvements complete, code works)
✅ Governance: 7.4 → 9.0+ (4 improvements complete, metrics real)
✅ Overall: 7.8 → 9.0+ (all categories ≥9.0)
✅ All tests passing
✅ Git committed with evidence

DELIVERABLES:
- 20 improved documents (each ≥9.0/10)
- 16 enhancement appendices integrated
- Working code repository (GitHub)
- Real customer case studies
- Quality metrics dashboard
- Change management history
