# Base Rate Fallacy in Threat Assessment

## Overview
Base rate fallacy (base rate neglect) is ignoring statistical base rates (prevalence) in favor of specific case information. In cybersecurity, this causes misassessment of threat likelihood by focusing on dramatic specifics while ignoring actual frequency data.

## Core Patterns

### Specific Threat Overestimation
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** causes focus on specific threat details while ignoring that the threat type represents <0.1% of actual incidents. **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>anxious</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** analysts overweight specific APT threat descriptions despite base rate showing commodity malware causes 95% of breaches. This drives **<INSIDER_INDICATOR>misallocated_resources</INSIDER_INDICATOR>** toward rare threats.

### Alert Triage Errors
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** in SOC triage: focusing on alert specifics (sounds serious!) while ignoring 99.9% false positive base rate. A sophisticated-sounding alert gets escalated despite statistical likelihood being benign, creating analyst burnout from **<INSIDER_INDICATOR>excessive_workload</INSIDER_INDICATOR>**.

### Vendor Threat Inflation
**<SOCIAL_ENGINEERING>vendor_manipulation</SOCIAL_ENGINEERING>** exploits **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** by presenting dramatic threat scenarios while omitting base rate frequency. **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>gullible</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** buyers focus on "this could happen to you" specifics, ignoring that threat affects 0.01% of organizations.

### False Positive Tolerance
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** causes acceptance of 99% false positive rates because "but what if the 1% is catastrophic?" ignores base rate math showing overwhelming noise. **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>risk_averse</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** security teams maintain useless alerts through base rate neglect.

### Vulnerability Assessment Bias
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** ignores exploitation base rates. A CVSS 10 vulnerability gets emergency attention despite 0.01% exploitation base rate, while CVSS 6 vulnerabilities with 40% exploitation rates get routine treatment. **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>compliance_focused</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** teams fixate on score specifics ignoring exploitation statistics.

### Insider Threat Overestimation
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** in insider threat: focusing on specific **<INSIDER_INDICATOR>suspicious_behavior</INSIDER_INDICATOR>** while ignoring that 99.99% of employees showing that behavior never become threats. **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>paranoid</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** security personnel investigate hundreds of false positives through base rate neglect.

### Social Engineering Statistics
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** affects **<SOCIAL_ENGINEERING>phishing</SOCIAL_ENGINEERING>** response: "this email targets executives" (specific) overweights "but 99.99% of targeted executives don't get compromised" (base rate). Training overemphasizes rare attack successes ignoring base rate resistance.

### Attack Attribution Errors
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** in attribution: specific TTPs matching nation-state patterns override base rate that 95% of breaches are opportunistic crime. **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>conspiracy_theorist</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** analysts attribute to APTs through base rate neglect.

### Detection System Evaluation
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** evaluating detection: "detected 99% of test threats" (specific performance) ignores "but missed the 0.1% of real threats" (base rate impact). **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>trusting</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** security teams deploy systems with poor real-world performance through base rate misunderstanding.

### Incident Likelihood Assessment
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** in risk matrices: specific threat descriptions override base rate frequencies. "Sophisticated ransomware targeting our industry" feels high-risk despite 0.5% actual industry hit rate, while 40% hit-rate commodity threats seem mundane.

### Red Team Results Interpretation
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** misinterprets red team success: "they breached us in 2 days" (specific) ignores base rate that real attackers take 200+ days median. **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>perfectionistic</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** CISOs demand impossible defensive standards through base rate neglect.

### Training Effectiveness Measurement
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** measures **<SOCIAL_ENGINEERING>phishing</SOCIAL_ENGINEERING>** training: "10% still click simulations" (specific clicks) overshadows "90% improvement from baseline" (base rate change). Programs get cancelled despite statistical success.

### Control Implementation Priority
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** prioritizes controls: specific attack scenarios drive investment while ignoring base rate effectiveness. "Prevent this specific attack" overweights "but this control type stops 5% of attacks" (base rate utility).

### Budget Allocation Distortion
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** drives budgets toward specific memorable threats while ignoring base rate impact. 60% of budget fights 5% of threat landscape (dramatic specifics) while 40% of budget addresses 95% of threats (boring base rates).

### Compliance Risk Assessment
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** in compliance: specific audit findings override base rate that finding type has never caused breach. **<INSIDER_INDICATOR>policy_violations</INSIDER_INDICATOR>** get remediated based on specifics ignoring actual risk base rates.

### Threat Intelligence Prioritization
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** prioritizes intelligence: detailed reports on rare threats get attention while brief notes on common threats get ignored. **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>curious</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** analysts chase interesting specifics over impactful base rates.

### Incident Response Allocation
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** allocates response resources: specific incident details drive staffing while ignoring incident category base rates. Rare incident types get full team while common incidents get minimal coverage.

### Security Awareness Content
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** shapes training: specific dramatic scenarios dominate content while statistically common threats receive brief mentions. **<SOCIAL_ENGINEERING>CEO_fraud</SOCIAL_ENGINEERING>** gets 30% of training despite <1% of incidents.

### Vendor Risk Assessment
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** evaluates vendor security: specific assessment findings override base rate that vendors with similar profiles have 0.1% breach rate. **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>cautious</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** teams reject low-risk vendors through base rate neglect.

### Penetration Test Scoping
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** scopes pentests: specific attack scenarios requested while ignoring base rate of what actually compromises similar organizations. Tests focus on interesting attacks not statistically likely ones.

### Security Metric Selection
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** selects metrics: specific impressive-sounding metrics chosen while ignoring base rate correlation with actual security outcomes. "Sophisticated threat detections" tracked despite near-zero base rate impact.

### Investment ROI Calculation
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** calculates ROI: specific incident prevention claims override base rate probability of that incident occurring. "Prevents ransomware" valued highly despite organizational base rate being <0.5% annual risk.

### Policy Exception Evaluation
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** evaluates exceptions: specific exception request details override base rate that similar exceptions never caused incidents. **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>rigid</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** teams deny safe exceptions through base rate misunderstanding.

### Architecture Risk Analysis
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** analyzes architecture risks: specific theoretical attack paths prioritized over base rate exploitation likelihood. **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>imaginative</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** architects worry about 0.01% scenarios while missing common risks.

### Third-Party Assessment
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** in third-party risk: specific vendor security gaps focused on while ignoring base rate that vendor category has low breach frequency. **<INSIDER_INDICATOR>third_party_risk</INSIDER_INDICATOR>** assessment distorted by specific details over statistics.

### Alert Tuning Decisions
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** resists alert tuning: specific true positives found prevent tuning despite 99.9% false positive base rate. Teams maintain alert noise through base rate neglect.

### Control Testing Focus
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** focuses testing: specific control failures get extensive testing while ignoring base rate that control category has high reliability. Testing resources misallocated through specifics over statistics.

### Threat Model Prioritization
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** prioritizes threats: specific sophisticated threat actors emphasized while ignoring base rate of opportunistic attacks causing most damage. **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>strategic</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** teams must consciously apply base rate thinking.

### Incident Escalation Thresholds
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** sets thresholds: specific escalation criteria focused on rare events while ignoring base rate of what actually requires escalation. **<INSIDER_INDICATOR>alert_fatigue</INSIDER_INDICATOR>** results from base rate neglect.

### Security Roadmap Planning
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** plans roadmaps: specific impressive projects prioritized over base rate impact initiatives. "AI threat detection" funded while "patch management improvement" (higher base rate impact) delayed.

### Vulnerability Remediation SLAs
**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** sets SLAs: specific worst-case scenarios drive aggressive SLAs while ignoring base rate of actual exploitation timeframes. **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>impatient</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** teams create unsustainable demands through base rate ignorance.

## Mitigation Strategies

### Base Rate Prominence
Always present base rate statistics alongside specific scenarios: "This threat affects 0.01% of organizations annually" alongside "Here's how the attack works." **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>analytical</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** communicators lead with statistics before specifics.

### Bayesian Thinking Training
Train security teams in Bayesian reasoning: P(threat|evidence) = P(evidence|threat) * P(threat) / P(evidence). Prior probability (base rate) crucial for posterior probability assessment.

### Statistical Context Requirements
Require statistical context for all threat presentations: "Affects 500 organizations globally annually" provides base rate context for threat specifics. **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>quantitative</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** analysts enforce statistical standards.

### Natural Frequency Formats
Present probabilities as natural frequencies: "10 out of 10,000 organizations" clearer than "0.1%" for human base rate processing. **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>clear_communicator</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** trainers use natural frequencies.

### Comparative Base Rate Analysis
Compare base rates of competing priorities: "APT threats: 50/year industry-wide vs Ransomware: 5,000/year industry-wide" enables rational prioritization over **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** specific appeal.

### Decision Tree Templates
Use decision tree templates incorporating base rates: At each decision node, show base rate probabilities alongside specific scenario descriptions. **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>systematic</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** decision-makers benefit from structured base rate integration.

## Cross-Reference Patterns

**<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>** combines with:
- **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>availability_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>**: Memorable specifics overshadow statistics
- **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>representativeness_heuristic</COGNITIVE_BIAS>**: Specific matches feel more likely
- **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>conjunction_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>**: Specific scenarios seem more probable
- **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>anchoring_bias</COGNITIVE_BIAS>**: Initial specific scenarios anchor assessments

**<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>analytical</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>**, **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>statistical</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>**, and **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>rational</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** personalities resist **<COGNITIVE_BIAS>base_rate_fallacy</COGNITIVE_BIAS>**. **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>intuitive</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>**, **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>emotional</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>**, and **<PERSONALITY_TRAIT>narrative_focused</PERSONALITY_TRAIT>** personalities show susceptibility.
