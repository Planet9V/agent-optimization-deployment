1. **Use streamlined format** (30-50 annotations per file)
   - Efficient annotation density
   - Maintains quality cross-referencing
   - Enables rapid completion

2. **Prioritize coverage breadth**
   - Complete all six cognitive bias categories
   - Ensure diverse security context coverage
   - Balance depth vs. breadth

3. **Maintain quality standards**
   - Cross-reference to personality traits
   - Link to insider indicators
   - Include social engineering context
   - Provide mitigation strategies
