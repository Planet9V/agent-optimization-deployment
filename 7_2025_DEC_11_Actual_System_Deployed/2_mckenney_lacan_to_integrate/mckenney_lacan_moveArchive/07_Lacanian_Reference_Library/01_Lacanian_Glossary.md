# Lacanian Glossary

> [!NOTE]
> This glossary provides definitions for key terms in Jacques Lacan's psychoanalytic theory. Terms are often interrelated and their meanings may evolve across Lacan's teaching.

## A

### **Act, Psychoanalytic**
An act that reconfigures the subject's relationship to the Symbolic and the Real. Unlike a simple behavior, a psychoanalytic act (like the analyst's interpretation or the analysand's moment of passing to the act) cuts through the chain of signifiers to produce a structural change.

### **Aggressivity**
A structural tension inherent in the formation of the ego. It arises from the capture of the subject's image in the mirror stage, leading to a rivalry between the fragmented body felt by the infant and the whole, coherent image seen in the mirror.

### **Alienation**
The first operation of causation of the subject. The subject is forced to choose between "being" and "meaning" (the vel of alienation). By choosing meaning (entering language), the subject loses a part of their being (the *objet a*), becoming split ($) and forever lacking.

### **Autre (Big Other)**
The radical alterity of language and the law.
- **The Symbolic Other (A):** The locus of the signifier; the treasury of language; the place from which speech ultimately emanates. It is not a person but a structural position (e.g., God, the Law, History).
- **The Other is lacking ($-A):** The realization that the Other does not guarantee truth or meaning; it has no final signifier.

### **autre (little other)**
The projection of the ego; the imaginary counterpart. The "little other" is the reflection of oneself found in the other person (specular image). It belongs to the Imaginary order.

## C

### **Castration**
The symbolic operation that introduces the lack. It is not the physical loss of an organ but the separation from the maternal object and the submission to the Law of the Free (the Symbolic order). Castration marks the entry into desire.

### **Chain of Signifiers**
The linkage of signifiers ($S_1 \rightarrow S_2$) that produces meaning. Meaning is not inherent in a word but arises from its difference and relation to other words. The subject ($) is "what a signifier represents for another signifier."

## D

### **Desire**
Desire is distinct from need (biological) and demand (articulated in language). Desire is the surplus that remains after need is subtracted from demand. It is fundamentally "desire of the Other" (desire for the Other's recognition and desire for what the Other desires).

### **Discourse**
A social link founded on language. Lacan identifies four (later five) discourses:
1. **Master:** Governing/Commanding.
2. **University:** Educating/Systematizing.
3. **Hysteric:** Questioning/Challenging.
4. **Analyst:** Subverting/Analyzing.
5. **Capitalist:** Consuming (a variation of the Master).

### **Drive (Trieb)**
Unlike biological instinct, drive has no fixed object. It circulates around the *objet a*. The four fundamental drives are Oral, Anal, Scopic, and Invocatory.

## E

### **Ego (Moi)**
An imaginary construct formed during the Mirror Stage. The ego is the site of misrecognition (*méconnaissance*) and defense. It strives for a false sense of unity and coherence.

### **Extimacy (Extimité)**
A neologism combining "exterior" and "intimacy." It refers to that which is most intimate to the subject yet remains foreign or alien (like the Real or the *objet a*).

## F

### **Fantasy**
Detailed as the formula ($ \diamond a $). The subject's stable relation to the object cause of desire. It is a protective window or screen that shields the subject from the horror of the Real and the lack in the Other.

### **Foreclosure (Verwerfung)**
The specific mechanism of psychosis. Unlike repression (neurosis), where a signifier is pushed into the unconscious, foreclosure expels the fundamental signifier (Name-of-the-Father) from the Symbolic universe entirely. When the foreclosed signifier returns, it returns in the Real (hallucinations).

## G

### **Gaze**
Not the act of seeing, but the object of the drive in the scopic field. The Gaze is outside the subject; it is the feeling of being watched by the object itself. "I see only from one point, but in my existence I am looked at from all sides."

## I

### **Imaginary (Register)**
One of the three orders (RSI). The realm of images, appearances, and surface phenomena. It is dominated by identification, narcissism, and dual relationships (me-you). The Mirror Stage is the founding moment of the Imaginary.

## J

### **Jouissance**
Often translated as "enjoyment," but it carries a connotation of excessive, painful, or transgressive pleasure. It is "suffering-pleasure" beyond the pleasure principle.
- **Phallic Jouissance:** Partial, related to the signifier.
- **Other Jouissance:** Ineffable, bodily, often associated with feminine sexuality.

## L

### **Lack (Manque)**
The fundamental condition of the subject. The subject is "want-to-be" (*manque-à-être*). Lack drives desire (we desire what we lack).

### **Lalangue**
A neologism combining "la langue" (the language). It refers to the mother tongue as it is experienced by the infant—a chaotic soup of sounds, equivocations, and nonsensical enjoyment, before it is structured by grammar.

## M

### **Matheme**
Lacan's attempt to transmit psychoanalytic theory through formal, quasi-mathematical formulas that can be taught integrally. Examples include the formulas of sexuation and the four discourses.

### **Mirror Stage**
A formative moment (6-18 months) where the infant identifies with a complete image of itself in a mirror (or caregiver). This identification anticipates a bodily unity the infant does not yet physically possess, establishing the Ego as an Ideal-I.

## N

### **Name-of-the-Father (Nom-du-Père)**
The fundamental signifier ($S_1$) that anchors the Symbolic order. It imposes the Law (prohibition of incest) and separates the child from the mother's desire, allowing the child to enter language and sanity. Its failure leads to psychosis.

## O

### **Objet petit a (Object *a*)**
The "object cause of desire." It is not the object we desire (like an apple or a car) but the void or gap *behind* that object that sets desire in motion. It is a piece of the Real that resists symbolization.

## P

### **Phallus**
Not the biological organ (penis), but a signifier ($ \Phi $) of lack and power. It is the signifier of desire. Men "have" it (in pretense), and women "are" it (masquerade), but no one possesses it.

## R

### **Real (Register)**
That which resists symbolization absolutely. The Real is not "reality" (which is constructed). The Real is the trauma, the impossible, the void, that which "always returns to the same place." It is outside language.

### **Repression (Verdrängung)**
The mechanism of neurosis. Something is recognized and then pushed into the unconscious. What is repressed returns in symptoms, slips of the tongue, and dreams.

## S

### **Separation**
The second operation of causation (after Alienation). The subject attacks the Other's discourse to find their own place, responding to the question "What does the Other want from me?" (*Che Vuoi?*).

### **Signifier**
The basic unit of language. A signifier has no meaning in itself; it only has meaning in relation to other signifiers. The signifier dominates the subject.

### **Sinthome**
Lacan's later spelling of "symptom." In his late teaching (Joyce seminar), the sinthome is a necessary fourth ring that knots the RSI (Real, Symbolic, Imaginary) together, preventing psychotic breakdown. It represents the subject's unique way of organizing their enjoyment.

### **Subject ($)**
 The barred subject. The subject is not the ego or the individual but a position produced by the signifier. The subject is split/barred because they are alienated in language.

### **Symbolic (Register)**
The realm of language, law, culture, and social exchange. It structures our reality. The unconscious is the discourse of the Other (Symbolic).

## T

### **Transference**
The redirection of feelings and desires retained from childhood toward a new object (the analyst). Lacan emphasizes the "Subject Supposed to Know" ($S_sS$)—transference occurs when the analysand supposes the analyst holds the knowledge of their suffering.

## U

### **Unconscious**
"The unconscious is structured like a language." It is not a primitive biological drive but a complex network of signifiers. It is the discourse of the Other.

## V

### **Vel (of Alienation)**
A logical "or" where the choice is forced. "Your money or your life": choose money, lose both; choose life, lose money. In alienation: choose being, lose meaning (psychosis/silence); choose meaning, lose being (castration).
