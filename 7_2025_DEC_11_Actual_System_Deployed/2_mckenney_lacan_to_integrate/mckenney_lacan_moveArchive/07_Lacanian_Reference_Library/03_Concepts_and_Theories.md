# Major Concepts and Theories

> [!NOTE]
> This document expounds on the core theoretical pillars of Lacanian psychoanalysis.

## 1. The Mirror Stage (*Le stade du miroir*)
**Origin:** 1936 / 1949 *Écrits*

The Mirror Stage describes the formation of the **Ego** (*Moi*).
Between 6 and 18 months, the human infant, still physically uncoordinated and fragmented (the "body in pieces"), recognizes its image in a mirror. This image is complete, unified, and masterful (Gestalt).
*   **The Identification:** The child identifies with this image: "That's me!"
*   **The Alienation:** This identification is based on a fiction. The "I" is constructed outside of oneself, in a reflection. Thus, "The Ego is an other."
*   **Aggressivity:** The tension between the clumsy physical body and the perfect image leads to structural aggressivity throughout life (rivalry with others who represent that perfect image).

## 2. The Three Registers (R.S.I.)
Lacan categorizes human experience into three knotted orders.

### The Imaginary (*L’Imaginaire*)
*   **Domain:** The visual, the dual relationship (me-you), the Ego, surface appearances, meaning/sens resemblance.
*   **Function:** It is the realm of illusion and seduction, but necessary for a sense of consistency.
*   **Example:** Thinking someone "understands you completely" (mirroring).

### The Symbolic (*Le Symbolique*)
*   **Domain:** Language, The Law, Culture, Social Exchange, Mathematical Logic.
*   **Function:** It structures the subject. We are born into a world of words (the discourse of the Other). The Symbolic introduces difference (Male/Female, Day/Night) and absence (the word kills the thing).
*   **Example:** A contract, a name, a marriage vow, a computer code.

### The Real (*Le Réel*)
*   **Domain:** That which resists symbolization. It is not "reality" (which is symbolic + imaginary). It is the impossible, the traumatic, the void.
*   **Function:** It is the "hard kernel" that disrupts our smooth understanding of the world.
*   **Example:** Trauma, anxiety, the physical organism's death, or the unrepresentable sexual drive.

## 3. The Unconscious Structured Like a Language
Lacan famously re-read Freud through Saussurean linguistics.

*   **Signifier (S) / Signified (s):** S/s. The bar separates them, and the Signifier dominates. Meaning is an effect of the play of signifiers.
*   **Metaphor:** One signifier replacing another ($S_2$ replaces $S_1$). This corresponds to Freud's **Condensation**. It creates new meaning (poetry, symptoms).
*   **Metonymy:** One signifier connecting to another ($S_1... S_2... S_3$). This corresponds to Freud's **Displacement**. It represents the eternal "fleeing" of desire (I want this, no, that, no, that...).

## 4. The Object *a* (*Objet petit a*)
The most original Lacanian concept. It serves as the **Cause of Desire**.
*   **Not the object of desire:** It is not the thing you want (e.g., the partner).
*   **The Cause:** It is the "something" *in* the partner that attracts you (the glint in the eye, the tone of voice).
*   **Types:** Oral object (breast/void), Anal object (feces/gift), Scopic object (Gaze), Invocatory object (Voice).
*   It is a piece of the Real—a remainder left over when the Subject enters the Symbolic.

## 5. Sexuation (There is no sexual relation)
In Seminar XX (*Encore*), Lacan argues that there is no "complementarity" between the sexes. There is no formula that writes the relationship between Man and Woman as a whole.

*   **The Masculine Side:** Defined by **Universality** ("All men fall under the phallic function") but sustained by an **Exception** (The Primal Father who is not castrated).
*   **The Feminine Side:** Defined by **"Not-All"** (*Pas-tout*). Women are fully in the phallic function but also have access to a "Supplementary Jouissance" (Other Jouissance) that goes beyond the phallus (mystical ecstasy).

## 6. Diagnosis: Clinical Structures
Diagnosis is structural, not based on symptoms (a hallucination can be hysterical, not necessarily psychotic). It depends on the subject's relation to the **Name-of-the-Father**.

1.  **Neurosis:** The Name-of-the-Father is instated. The subject accepts Castration but **Represses** it.
    *   *Obsessional:* Tries to control the Other, treats desire as a demand/contract.
    *   *Hysteric:* Questions the Master, identifies with the lack, asks "Am I a man or a woman?"
2.  **Psychosis:** The Name-of-the-Father is **Foreclosed** (rejected entirely). A hole is left in the Symbolic. Since the Law is not internal, it returns from the Real as hallucination (voices).
3.  **Perversion:** The subject **Disavows** (*Verleugnung*) Castration. "I know very well (mother has no phallus), but all the same..." The pervert makes themselves the instrument of the Other's enjoyment.
