# IEC 62443 Cybersecurity Workshop Strategy and Scenario Development for City Rail Link (CRL) New Zealand

## 1. Executive Summary and Strategic Alignment

The City Rail Link (CRL) project represents a paradigm shift for Auckland's transport infrastructure, transforming the Britomart transport hub into a two-way through-station and significantly expanding the rail capacity of New Zealand’s largest city.^^ As the project transitions from heavy civil engineering to the intricate phase of architectural and systems integration, the cybersecurity of its Operational Technology (OT) becomes a foundational element of its safety case. This report outlines a comprehensive execution strategy for developing the Cyber Security Management Plan (CSMP) through a series of five targeted workshops. ** **

The strategy is predicated on the rigorous application of IEC 62443, the international standard for Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) security, and its railway-specific adaptation, EN 50701.^^ The primary objective is to reconcile the theoretical security requirements designed during the preliminary phases with the "as-built" reality delivered by the Link Alliance—a consortium where Downer leads construction and integration, Honeywell delivers critical Building Management Systems (BMS) and safety controllers, and SICE provides the overarching SIDERA SCADA and Tunnel Ventilation Systems (TVS).^^ ** **

The methodology detailed herein bridges the gap between functional safety (RAMS—Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, and Safety) and cybersecurity. By treating cyber threats as credible initiators of physical hazards—such as the failure of the Tunnel Ventilation System (TVS) during a fire event—we ensure that the final CSMP is not merely a compliance document but a robust safety assurance tool. The process culminates in a structured handover to KiwiRail and Auckland Transport (AT), ensuring that the digital assets are integrated into their respective asset management and operational frameworks.^^ ** **

### 1.1 The Operational Environment and Threat Landscape

The CRL environment involves a 3.45 km twin-tunnel underground rail link running up to 42 meters below the city center, connecting the new stations of Te Waihorotiu and Karanga-a-Hape with the redeveloped Maungawhau station.^^ This subterranean environment introduces unique "piston effects" and smoke control challenges that necessitate a highly automated and fail-safe ventilation system.^^ ** **

The threat landscape for such critical infrastructure is evolving. As rail systems become increasingly digitized and interconnected, they face "hybrid threats"—a combination of physical sabotage and cyber-attacks designed to maximize disruption and prevent recovery.^^ A cyber-attack on the CRL is not just a data breach; it is a potential mass-casualty event if it coincides with a physical incident like a fire. Therefore, the workshops are designed to enforce a "Security-Informed Safety" approach, ensuring that the TVS and other life-safety systems maintain high integrity even under a sophisticated cyber assault. ** **

### 1.2 Regulatory and Standards Compliance

The workshop series is structured to produce artifacts that satisfy specific regulatory requirements:

* **IEC 62443-3-2:** For Risk Assessment and Zone/Conduit partitioning.
* **IEC 62443-3-3:** For defining System Security Requirements and Security Levels (SL).
* **EN 50701:** For the overall Railway Cybersecurity Lifecycle and the "Cybersecurity Case".^^ ** **
* **EN 50126 (RAMS):** Ensuring cyber risks are reflected in the Hazard Log.^^ ** **
* **KiwiRail & AT Standards:** Aligning with the "Digital Engineering Asset Information Requirements" and operational handover protocols.^^ ** **

## 2. Strategic Workshop Planning: The "V-Model" Approach

The five workshops are sequenced to follow the systems engineering "V-Model," moving from high-level hazard analysis to detailed design verification, physical implementation review, and finally, operational validation and handover.

## 3. Workshop 1: Worst-Case Scenario & RAMS Integration

### 3.1 Objective and Theoretical Framework

The foundational workshop serves to anchor the cybersecurity program in physical reality. It addresses the "Design Hand" Hazard Log and Reliability (RAMS) data to demonstrate that cybersecurity is a subset of safety.^^ The primary goal is to derive the "Worst-Case Scenario" that will drive the security requirements for the rest of the project. ** **

In the context of the CRL, the most critical hazard is an uncontrolled fire in the tunnel. The Tunnel Ventilation System (TVS) is the primary mitigation for this hazard. If the TVS fails due to a cyber-attack, the "Tenable Environment" for passenger evacuation is lost.^^ This workshop must quantify that risk. ** **

### 3.2 Preparation and Talking Notes

#### 3.2.1 Pre-Workshop Analysis

The facilitation team must review the existing  **CRL Hazard Log** , specifically filtering for hazards rated "Catastrophic" (loss of life). They must also review the **Fire Engineering Strategy** to understand the airflow requirements (critical velocity) needed to prevent back-layering of smoke over evacuating passengers.^^ ** **

#### 3.2.2 Opening Talking Notes (The "Why")

* "Gentlemen, today we are not discussing firewalls or passwords. We are discussing the physics of smoke and the preservation of life. EN 50701 requires us to treat cybersecurity as a contributor to the Safety Case. If a hacker can stop the fans, they can kill passengers just as effectively as a mechanical bearing seizure."
* "We need to review the 'Design Hand' Hazard Log. Currently, it likely lists 'Control System Failure' as a random event with a probability of **1**0**−**5 per hour. A cyber-attack is not random; it is intentional. Therefore, traditional redundancy (A/B systems) is ineffective because an attacker will compromise both simultaneously."

### 3.3 The Visual Aside: The Bow-Tie Diagram

The central activity of this workshop is the construction of a  **Cyber-Physical Bow-Tie Diagram** . This visual aid connects the digital threat to the physical consequence.^^ ** **

**Visual Construction on Whiteboard:**

1. **The Knot (Top Event):** *Loss of Tunnel Ventilation Control during a Fire Event.*
2. **Left Side (Threats/Initiating Events):**
   * *Threat A:* Supply Chain Attack (Malware introduced via SICE maintenance laptop).
   * *Threat B:* Insider Threat (Disgruntled employee with SCADA access).
   * *Threat C:* Network Intrusion (Pivot from Station Wi-Fi to Control Network).
3. **Left Barriers (Preventative Controls):**
   * *Barrier 1:* Network Segmentation (Zone 3 Isolation).
   * *Barrier 2:* Authentication (MFA for critical commands).
   * *Barrier 3:* Input Validation (PLC logic rejects "Stop" command if fire is detected).
4. **Right Side (Consequences):**
   * *Consequence A:* Smoke descends to track level.
   * *Consequence B:* Passenger disorientation and asphyxiation.
   * *Consequence C:* Inability for emergency services to enter.
5. **Right Barriers (Mitigative Controls):**
   * *Barrier 1:* Hardwired "Fireman's Override" Panel (Physical bypass of digital systems).
   * *Barrier 2:* Passive smoke curtains.
   * *Barrier 3:* Emergency lighting and wayfinding (independent of SCADA).

**Strategic Insight:** The diagram will reveal that while digital preventative barriers are important, the *ultimate* safety often relies on the Mitigative Barriers (Hardwired Override). The workshop must confirm that this hardwired override is *truly* independent of the software logic (i.e., it cuts power to the VSD control board and forces contactors directly).

### 3.4 Scenario Development: "The Silent Fire"

To drive the point home, the team will develop a detailed narrative scenario:

* **Context:** A train stalls in the tunnel between Te Waihorotiu and Maungawhau. A small electrical fire starts on the undercarriage.
* **The Cyber Attack:** An attacker has compromised the SICE SIDERA SCADA system. They do not shut the system down; instead, they launch a "Man-in-the-Middle" attack on the sensor data.
* **The Effect:** The SCADA screen in the Control Center shows "Normal Operation" and "Green" status for all smoke sensors. The automatic fire detection sequences are suppressed. The operators are unaware of the fire.
* **The Critical Failure:** When passengers finally call via emergency intercoms, the operator attempts to activate "extract mode." The compromised SCADA ignores the command or, worse, activates "supply mode," pushing smoke *toward* the passengers.^^ ** **
* **RAMS Implication:** This scenario demonstrates a "Dangerous Failure" that bypasses standard redundancy. It justifies the assignment of **Security Level 3 (SL-3)** or **SL-4** to the TVS Zone.

### 3.5 Artifacts Produced

1. **Updated Safety Hazard Log:** Now including specific "Cyber-Initiated" causes for all high-severity tunnel hazards.
2. **Cyber-Physical Bow-Tie Diagrams:** Documenting the barriers for the top 3 critical hazards.
3. **Scenario Definition Document:** A formal narrative of "The Silent Fire" to be used for testing and validation.

## 4. Workshop 2: Supplier LLD & Zone/Conduit Definition

### 4.1 Objective and Scope

With the safety stakes established, Workshop 2 engages the technical leads from the suppliers (SICE and Honeywell) to analyze their Low-Level Designs (LLD). The objective is to define the **Zones and Conduits** architecture as per IEC 62443-3-2 and justify the **Target Security Levels (SL-T)** for each zone.^^ ** **

This workshop is critical for identifying the "Conduits"—the communication paths between zones—which are often the weakest links in a multi-vendor environment.

### 4.2 Preparation and Pre-Reading

* **Review Supplier Architectures:**
  * **SICE SIDERA:** Understand its modular, open-source nature (often based on OpenStack/Kubernetes) and its reliance on standard IT protocols.^^ ** **
  * **Honeywell Safety Manager SC:** Review its SIL 3 certification, proprietary LEAP technology, and Universal I/O structure.^^ ** **
* **Interface Control Documents (ICDs):** Identify how SICE and Honeywell talk. Is it Modbus TCP? OPC UA? BACnet?

### 4.3 Workshop Agenda and Talking Points

#### 4.3.1 Defining the Zones (The Purdue Model Adaptation)

* **Talking Point:** "We need to map the CRL operational reality to the IEC 62443 zones. A flat network is unacceptable. We must segment based on criticality and function."
* **Visual Aside: The Zone Diagram:** Draw a customized Purdue Model on the whiteboard:
  * **Zone 4 (Enterprise):** Connections to Auckland Transport corporate IT (ticketing, scheduling). *SL-T: 2.*
  * **Zone 3 (Operations/Control - Vital):** **The TVS Zone.** Contains Honeywell Safety Manager SC and critical SICE Remote Stations. This is the "Sanctuary." *SL-T: 3.*
  * **Zone 2 (Station Control - Non-Vital):** Station BMS, Lighting, Passenger Information Systems (PIDS). *SL-T: 2.*
  * **Zone 1 (Field Devices):** Sensors, Actuators, VSDs. *SL-T: 1 (Physically protected).*
  * **Zone 0 (Physical Process):** The tunnel environment itself.

#### 4.3.2 The Conduit Deep Dive: Honeywell vs. SICE

* **Critical Analysis:** The interface between Honeywell (Safety) and SICE (SCADA) is the most critical conduit. SICE provides the "eyes" (HMI), but Honeywell provides the "brains" (Safety Logic).
* **Talking Point to Suppliers:** "SICE, your SIDERA system sits in Zone 3 (Ops). Honeywell, your Safety Manager is in Zone 3 (Safety). How do you connect? If it's Modbus TCP over a standard switch, that conduit is currently **SL-1** (no encryption, no authentication). We need it to be  **SL-3** ."
* **Technical Challenge:** Legacy protocols like Modbus do not support encryption.
* **Mitigation Discussion:** "We must wrap this conduit. We need a **Secure Gateway** or **VPN Tunnel** between the SCADA and the PLC. Alternatively, we use a **Data Diode** if the flow is purely monitoring, or strict **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)** firewalls if control is required."

#### 4.3.3 Justification of Security Level Targets (SL-T)

* **Activity:** Systematic review of the "Foundational Requirements" (FRs) for the TVS Zone.
* **Justification for SL-3 (TVS Zone):** "The TVS is a life-safety system. A successful attack results in loss of life (as established in Workshop 1). The threat actor profile includes sophisticated hacktivists or nation-state actors targeting critical infrastructure. Therefore, we require protections against 'intentional violation using sophisticated means with moderate resources' (IEC 62443 definition of SL-3).^^" ** **
* **Implication for Suppliers:**
  * **Honeywell:** Must enable "Secure Boot," "Role-Based Access Control," and disable unused services on the Safety Manager SC.^^ ** **
  * **SICE:** Must demonstrate rigorous patch management for their Linux/Windows servers and secure coding practices for the SIDERA application.^^ ** **

### 4.4 Artifacts Produced

1. **Zone and Conduit Diagram (ZCR):** A detailed architectural map showing all assets and their zone assignments.
2. **Conduit Matrix:** A list of all allowed traffic flows (Source IP, Dest IP, Port, Protocol) for every conduit.
3. **SL-T Definition Document:** Formal justification for assigning SL-3 to the TVS and SL-2 to Station Systems.
4. **Gap Analysis Register:** Identifying where current designs (e.g., unencrypted Modbus) fail to meet the SL-T.

## 5. Workshop 3: The TVS Deep Dive (High Rated Zone 3)

### 5.1 Objective and Scope

This workshop focuses exclusively on the  **Tunnel Ventilation System (TVS)** , the project's critical "High Rated Zone 3" asset. The goal is to decompose the system into its constituent components (nodes) to minimize the attack surface and define specific security configuration requirements. This deep dive is necessary because the TVS lies at the intersection of high power (megawatt fans), complex aerodynamics (piston effect), and life safety.^^ ** **

### 5.2 Preparation and Talking Notes

#### 5.2.1 Component Decomposition

* **Preparation:** Review the specific hardware models.
  * **Controllers:** Honeywell Safety Manager SC (SIL3).
  * **Drives:** Variable Speed Drives (VSDs) for Axial Fans.
  * **Field I/O:** Distributed I/O modules in cross-passages.
  * **Network:** Ring topology switches (likely Moxa or Cisco IE series).^^ ** **

#### 5.2.2 Opening Talking Notes

* "We have agreed the TVS is Zone 3. Now we must harden it. We cannot secure 'The System' as a vague concept; we must secure the  *Nodes* . A VSD is not just a motor starter; it is a computer with a network card and a web server. If I can hack the VSD, I can burn out the fan motor by rapidly cycling it."

#### 5.2.3 Narrowing the Nodes (Attack Surface Reduction)

* **Activity:** Walk through the configuration of each component type on the whiteboard.
* **Node 1: Honeywell Safety Manager SC**
  * *Question:* "Does the PLC have a web interface enabled for diagnostics?"
  * *Action:* **Disable it.** Diagnostic access should only be via the engineering station over a specific, monitored conduit.
  * *Question:* "Are unused physical ports on the processor module disabled?"
  * *Action:* **Disable and lock.**
* **Node 2: Variable Speed Drives (VSDs)**
  * *Question:* "How does the PLC talk to the VSD? Profinet? Ethernet/IP?"
  * *Risk:* These protocols are often vulnerable to "packet flooding" which causes the drive to trip (Denial of Service).
  * *Mitigation:* **Rate Limiting** on the switch ports connected to VSDs. Implementation of **"Anti-Cycling Logic"** in the PLC code—a software interlock that prevents the fan from being restarted within 5 minutes of a stop, regardless of the command source. *This is a key Cyber-Physical barrier.*

#### 5.2.4 The SICE-Honeywell Integration Challenge

* **Topic:** SICE provides the SIDERA interface, which runs on standard servers (more vulnerable). Honeywell provides the safety logic (more robust).
* **Visual Aside: Data Flow Diagram (DFD):** Draw the command path for "Fan Start."
  * *Operator (SICE HMI)* -> *SICE Server* -> *Conduit* -> *Honeywell PLC* ->  *VSD* .
* **Constraint:** The Honeywell Safety Manager must treat the SICE Server as  **untrusted** .
  * *Requirement:* The PLC code must contain "Range Checks" and "Sanity Checks." If SICE sends a command to "Reverse Fan" while it is spinning at 100% Forward, the PLC must reject the command to prevent physical destruction of the fan blades.
  * *Insight:* This moves security from "Network Filtering" to "Process Logic." It is the most robust form of protection against a compromised SCADA system.

### 5.3 Artifacts Produced

1. **TVS Component Hardening Guide:** A checklist of services to disable, ports to close, and password policies for every device type in Zone 3.
2. **Secure Logic Specification:** A set of requirements for the Honeywell PLC code (e.g., anti-cycling timers, sanity checks) to prevent physical damage.
3. **Compensating Controls Register:** A list of legacy devices (e.g., specific vibration sensors) that cannot meet SL-3 and the physical/network mitigations applied to them.

---

## 6. Workshop 4: CSMP Completion & Site Walkthrough

### 6.1 Objective and Scope

This workshop moves the focus from design documentation to physical reality. Led by Downer, the team will perform a site walkthrough of a representative station (e.g., Maungawhau) to verify the "As-Is" installation against the CSMP requirements. This "Ground Truthing" is essential for managing exceptions.

### 6.2 Preparation and Talking Notes

#### 6.2.1 CSMP Finalization

* **Activity:** Review the draft Cyber Security Management Plan (CSMP) against the **EN 50701** template.^^ ** **
* **Focus Areas:**
  * **Patch Management:** "How will we patch the SICE servers in an operational railway? We need a defined maintenance window and a test bed."
  * **Incident Response:** "If the TVS screens go black, who does the operator call? Is there a playbook for a cyber-event vs. a hardware failure?"

#### 6.2.2 The "As-Is" Site Walkthrough

* **Location:** Equipment Rooms (CER/SER) at Maungawhau Station.
* **Visual Aside: The Physical Security Checklist:**
  * **Cabinet Integrity:** Are the server cabinets locked? Do they have tamper switches connected to the BMS? (Requirement from ^^). ** **
  * **Port Security:** Look at the network switches. are unused ports open? Are there RJ45 locks installed?
  * **Cable Tracing:** Are the Red (A) and Blue (B) redundant network cables routed in *separate* physical conduits? If they are in the same tray, a single physical act (or fire) cuts both, negating redundancy.^^ ** **
  * **USB Hygiene:** Check the HMI workstations. Are USB ports physically accessible? They should be blocked or disabled via software.

#### 6.2.3 Exception Management

* **Reality Check:** The walkthrough will inevitably find non-compliances (e.g., a legacy fire panel that requires an open Telnet port).
* **Process:** We do not "fail" the system; we raise an  **Exception** .
  * *Risk:* Unauthorized access via Telnet.
  * *Mitigation:* The device is in a locked cabinet (physical) and behind a specific firewall rule (network).
  * *Acceptance:* The Asset Owner (KiwiRail) must sign off on this residual risk.

### 6.3 Artifacts Produced

1. **Draft Final CSMP:** Updated with specific procedures for the CRL environment.
2. **Site Audit Report:** Photographic evidence of physical security findings (Good and Bad).
3. **Exception Register:** A log of all non-compliant devices and the compensating controls applied.
4. **Remediation Action Plan:** A list of immediate physical fixes (e.g., "Install cabinet locks in Room 302").

---

## 7. Workshop 5: Stakeholder Presentation & Handover

### 7.1 Objective and Scope

The final phase (split into two sessions if necessary) presents the completed CSMP and Risk Profile to the final stakeholders: **KiwiRail** (Network Owner) and **Auckland Transport** (Operator). The goal is to obtain "Approval to Operate" and ensure a seamless handover of digital assets in alignment with Asset Information Requirements (AIR).

### 7.2 Preparation and Talking Notes

#### 7.2.1 Presentation to Stakeholders

* **Strategy:** Frame the conversation around **Safety** and  **Reliability** .
* **Talking Point:** "We have applied EN 50701 to ensure the CRL is safe by design. We have identified the TVS as our critical asset and hardened it to Security Level 3. We have verified this through physical audit."
* **Visual Aside: The Residual Risk Heatmap:** Show the "Before" (Inherent Risk - Red) and "After" (Residual Risk - Yellow/Green) status. Highlight that the "Silent Fire" scenario is now blocked by multiple barriers.

#### 7.2.2 The Handover Plan (KiwiRail & AT)

* **Requirement:** KiwiRail has specific  **Digital Engineering Asset Information Requirements (AIR)** .^^ They require asset data to be formatted for their Maximo/SAP systems. ** **
* **Deliverable:** The "Digital Asset Register." This is not just a list; it is a structured database containing:
  * Asset ID (KiwiRail Schema).
  * Firmware Version.
  * MAC Address / IP Address.
  * Associated Zone (Safety/Non-Safety).
  * Patching Schedule.
* **Operational Transfer:**
  * **Vulnerability Management:** Transferring the responsibility for monitoring CERT NZ alerts to the KiwiRail SOC.
  * **Access Control:** Handing over the "Master Keys" (Admin passwords) via a secure, audited ceremony.
  * **Training:** Providing the "Cyber Safety" training modules for the rail operators.

#### 7.2.3 Final Sign-Off

* **Activity:** Reviewing the **Exception Register** with the stakeholders.
* **Talking Point:** "We have 5 exceptions where legacy constraints prevented full SL-3 compliance. We have applied compensating controls. We need your signature to accept this residual risk."

### 7.3 Artifacts Produced

1. **Final Signed CSMP:** The governing document for the operational life of the system.
2. **Digital Asset Register:** Formatted for ingestion into KiwiRail's asset management system.
3. **Handover Plan:** A timeline for the transfer of credentials and responsibility.
4. **Safety Case (Cyber Contribution):** The formal evidence that cyber risks have been reduced to ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable).

## 9. Conclusion

The City Rail Link is a complex system of systems where digital logic controls physical safety. This report has outlined a robust, standards-based approach to securing that interface. By rigorously applying IEC 62443 and EN 50701 through these five targeted workshops, the Link Alliance will not only achieve compliance but will deliver a resilient transport infrastructure capable of withstanding the evolving threat landscape. The ultimate output is not just a plan, but a verified, hardened operational reality that safeguards the lives of Auckland's commuters.

### 9.1 Key Recommendations for the Lead Consultant

1. **Enforce the Conduit:** The digital link between the Honeywell Safety Manager and the SICE SIDERA platform is the single most critical risk vector. dedicate disproportionate effort to securing this specific interface.
2. **Leverage "Safety" Language:** When speaking to Project Directors, talk about "Passenger Safety" and "Reliability," not "Cybersecurity." This ensures resource allocation.
3. **Respect the Legacy:** Do not fight the existence of legacy/non-compliant devices. Use the Exception Management process to handle them transparently.
4. **Data is the Handover:** The final value to KiwiRail is the accuracy of the Digital Asset Register. Ensure this data is pristine.
