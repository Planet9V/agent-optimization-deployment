## Framework Descriptions

### 1. Enneagram System (9 types, 27 subtypes)

The Enneagram provides deep insight into core motivations, fears, and behavioral patterns affecting security decision-making.

**Files**:
- Type 1: The Perfectionist/Reformer
- Type 2: The Helper/Giver
- Type 3: The Achiever/Performer
- Type 4: The Individualist/Romantic
- Type 5: The Investigator/Observer
- Type 6: The Loyalist/Skeptic
- Type 7: The Enthusiast/Adventurer
- Type 8: The Challenger/Leader
- Type 9: The Peacemaker/Mediator
- Wings & Integration Paths

**Coverage**: Each type includes wing variations (w4, w5, etc.), integration/disintegration paths, and three subtypes (Self-preservation, Social, Sexual)

**Applications**: Understanding core security motivations, predicting stress responses, identifying growth opportunities

### 2. HEXACO Personality Model (6 dimensions)

Evidence-based six-factor model superior to Big Five for predicting counterproductive work behaviors including insider threats.

**Dimensions**:
- **Honesty-Humility**: Predicts ethical behavior and rule-following
- **Emotionality**: Affects stress response and crisis management
- **Extraversion**: Influences communication and team dynamics
- **Agreeableness**: Impacts cooperation vs. conflict patterns
- **Conscientiousness**: Predicts reliability and attention to detail
- **Openness**: Affects innovation adoption and creative problem-solving

**Coverage**: Each dimension analyzed at facet level (6 facets per dimension) with security-specific applications

**Applications**: Pre-employment screening, role optimization, team composition, security culture assessment

### 3. Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (16 types, 8 functions)

Cognitive preference framework analyzing information processing and decision-making styles in security contexts.

**All 16 Types Covered**: INTJ, INTP, ENTJ, ENTP, INFJ, INFP, ENFJ, ENFP, ISTJ, ISFJ, ESTJ, ESFJ, ISTP, ISFP, ESTP, ESFP

**Cognitive Functions**: Ti, Te, Fi, Fe, Ni, Ne, Si, Se
- Dominant: Primary cognitive strength
- Auxiliary: Supporting function
- Tertiary: Development area
- Inferior: Stress vulnerability

**Applications**: Security role matching, communication strategies, team composition, leadership development

### 4. Attachment Theory (4 styles)

Relationship and trust patterns critical for understanding organizational loyalty and betrayal psychology.

**Styles**:
- **Secure**: Trusts appropriately, low insider risk
- **Anxious-Preoccupied**: Approval-seeking, vulnerability to manipulation
- **Dismissive-Avoidant**: Isolated, reduces oversight effectiveness
- **Fearful-Avoidant**: Unpredictable, higher risk under stress

**Coverage**: Interpersonal, organizational, and security-specific trust patterns plus betrayal trauma analysis

**Applications**: Trust-based access control, relationship security vetting, organizational commitment assessment

### 5. Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI)

Assesses narcissistic traits ranging from healthy confidence to pathological grandiosity affecting security behavior.

**Factors Analyzed**:
- **Grandiosity & Leadership**: Inflated self-importance, authority challenges
- **Entitlement & Exploitativeness**: Policy exemption beliefs, access abuse
- **Vulnerable/Covert Narcissism**: Hypersensitivity, passive-aggressive sabotage

**Coverage**: Both overt (grandiose) and covert (vulnerable) narcissism with corporate context adaptations

**Applications**: Leadership screening, access privilege risk assessment, organizational narcissism detection

### 6. Psychopathy Checklist - Revised (PCL-R adapted)

Corporate psychopathy assessment for identifying high-risk manipulative insiders.

**Factors**:
- **Factor 1 (Interpersonal/Affective)**: Superficial charm, lying, lack of remorse/empathy
- **Factor 2 (Lifestyle/Antisocial)**: Impulsivity, irresponsibility, parasitic behavior
- **Manipulation & Deception**: Advanced manipulation techniques, gaslighting, triangulation

**Coverage**: Adapted for organizational contexts with focus on white-collar psychopathy manifestations

**Applications**: High-risk insider identification, social engineering vulnerability, organizational protection

## Annotation Structure

Every annotation follows standardized format:

```
**PERSONALITY_TRAIT**: Description of trait in security context
**INSIDER_INDICATOR**: Specific insider threat manifestation
**COGNITIVE_BIAS**: Associated systematic thinking error
**THREAT_ACTOR**: Threat profile when trait becomes pathological (when applicable)
```

## Cross-Framework Integration

All frameworks cross-reference each other for comprehensive assessment:

- **Enneagram ↔ HEXACO**: Type 1 correlates with high Conscientiousness
- **Enneagram ↔ MBTI**: Type 5 often INTP/INTJ, Type 2 often ESFJ/ENFJ
- **HEXACO ↔ Attachment**: Low Honesty-Humility correlates with insecure attachment
- **Narcissism ↔ Psychopathy**: Factor 1 psychopathy overlaps with grandiose narcissism
- **All frameworks ↔ Insider threat risk profiles**

## Use Cases

### Pre-Employment Screening
- Identify personality patterns associated with insider threat risk
- Match candidates to appropriate security roles
- Assess cultural fit and values alignment
- Predict performance under security stress

### Ongoing Risk Management
- Monitor behavioral changes indicating increased risk
- Early warning systems for insider threat indicators
- Targeted interventions based on personality patterns
- Crisis prediction and prevention

### Security Culture Development
- Personality-aware security training programs
- Communication strategies optimized by type
- Team composition for optimal security performance
- Leadership style matching to organizational needs

### Post-Incident Analysis
- Psychological profiling of insider threat actors
- Understanding motivation and decision-making
- Preventing future similar incidents
- Organizational vulnerability identification

### Role Optimization
- Match security professionals to suitable roles
- Identify development areas and growth paths
- Build balanced security teams
- Succession planning for critical positions

## Assessment Integration

These frameworks complement technical insider threat detection with psychological profiling:

**Technical Indicators**:
- Access patterns
- Data exfiltration attempts
- Policy violations
- System misuse

**Behavioral Indicators** (from these frameworks):
- Personality-based risk factors
- Stress response patterns
- Relationship dynamics
- Motivation analysis

**Combined Approach**: Technical + Behavioral = Comprehensive insider threat program

## Research Foundation

All frameworks based on established psychological research:

- **Enneagram**: Ancient wisdom system validated by modern psychology research
- **HEXACO**: Academic research model superior to Big Five for counterproductive behaviors
- **MBTI**: Jungian cognitive psychology applied to organizational contexts
- **Attachment Theory**: Bowlby/Ainsworth developmental psychology adapted to organizations
- **NPI**: Standard narcissism assessment used in organizational psychology
- **PCL-R**: Hare's psychopathy research adapted for corporate contexts

## Ethical Considerations

**Privacy**: Personality assessments must respect individual privacy and dignity
**Consent**: Always obtain informed consent before personality assessment
**Fairness**: No single framework should determine employment or access decisions
**Professional Use**: Assessments should be conducted or interpreted by qualified professionals
**Legal Compliance**: Ensure assessments comply with employment law and regulations

## Training Applications

Use these frameworks to develop:

1. **Insider Threat Awareness Training**: Teach security teams to recognize personality-based risk indicators
2. **Security Leadership Development**: Develop personality-aware leadership approaches
3. **Team Building**: Build effective security teams with complementary personalities
4. **Communication Skills**: Tailor security messaging to personality types
5. **Stress Management**: Identify and address personality-specific stress vulnerabilities
