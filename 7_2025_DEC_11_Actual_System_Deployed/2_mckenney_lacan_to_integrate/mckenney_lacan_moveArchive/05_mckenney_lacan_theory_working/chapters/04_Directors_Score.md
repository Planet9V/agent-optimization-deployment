## 4.1 The Director’s Score (Unified Field Table)

The **Director’s Score** acts as the central unification interface for the McKenney-Lacan Calculus. It maps the abstract algebraic registers of Lacan to the concrete measurable parameters of modern psychometrics (Elastic Moduli) and dynamic risk factors (Biases).

This table is "The Score" because, like an orchestral conductor's score, it allows an analyst (Director) to see all vertical harmonies (correlations) and horizontal progressions (dynamics) at once.

| Lacanian Discourse | Vector Axis ($\psi$) | Elastic Modulus (Personality) | Bias Risk (Perturbation) | Musical Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Master ($\Phi$)**<br>*(Governing / Law)* | $v_S$ (Symbolic) | **High Bulk Modulus ($K$)**<br>*(Conscientiousness)*<br>Rigid adherence to code. | **Locking Operator**<br>(Authority Bias, Status Quo)<br>*Risk: Brittleness* | **Pedal Point (Tonic)**<br>Fixed fundamental freq.<br>Foundation of key. |
| **University ($U$)**<br>*(Knowledge / System)* | $v_{Cog}$ (Cognitive) | **High Shear Modulus ($G$)**<br>*(Openness-Intellect)*<br>Structured complexity. | **Damping Operator**<br>(Confirmation Bias, Theory-Induced Blindness)<br>*Risk: Filters out 'Bad Data'* | **Fugue / Counterpoint**<br>Complex, rule-bound<br>interweaving of voices. |
| **Hysteric ($\$$)**<br>*(Questioning / Split)* | $v_I$ (Imaginary) | **High Volatility ($\sigma$)**<br>*(Neuroticism)*<br>Sensitivity to lack/gap. | **Inversion Operator**<br>(Reactance, Hyper-Vigilance)<br>*Risk: Signal Amplification* | **Chromaticism / Dissonance**<br>Unresolved tension<br>seeking resolution. |
| **Analyst ($a$)**<br>*(Listening / Cause)* | $v_R$ (Real) | **High Transparency ($\tau$)**<br>*(Honesty-Humility)*<br>Low noise/ego distortion. | **Neutralizer**<br>(Debiasing, Meta-Cognition)<br>*Risk: Social Alienation* | **Silence / Cage-ian Gap**<br>The space where the<br>sound resonates. |
| **Capitalist ($\$$/$\$$)**<br>*(Consumption / Circular)* | $v_{Ag}$ (Agential) | **Low Viscosity ($\nu$)**<br>*(Extraversion-Assertive)*<br>Rapid, frictionless exchange. | **Inversion Operator (Feedback)**<br>(FOMO, Bandwagon Effect)<br>*Risk: Runaway consumption* | **Ostinato / Minimalist Loop**<br>Repetitive, driving,<br>accelerating pulse. |

## 4.2 Interpreting the Score

### 4.2.1 Vertical Harmony (Correlation)
A subject with a "Master Signifier" orientation ($\Phi$) will naturally exhibit:
1.  **High Conscientiousness** ($High\ K$).
2.  Susceptibility to **Authority Bias** (locking into a hierarchy).
3.  A behavioral "tone" that acts as a **Pedal Point**—stabilizing the team but potentially arresting innovation.

### 4.2.2 Horizontal Progression (Modulation)
Ideally, a healthy subject or organization **modulates** between these states:
*   Use **Master** mode to set policy ($High\ K$).
*   Switch to **Hysteric** mode to question flaws ($High\ \sigma$).
*   Enter **Analyst** mode to listen to the Real data ($High\ \tau$).

Pathology occurs when a subject is **locked** into a single row (e.g., "The Rigid Master" who cannot modulate to "Listening," leading to structural fracture when the Biases amplify the rigidity).
