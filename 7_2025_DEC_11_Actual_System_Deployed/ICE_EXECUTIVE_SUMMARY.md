## 🚀 PRIORITIZATION APPROACH

### ICE Scoring Framework

**Impact (1-10):** Business value, user benefit, strategic importance
**Confidence (1-10):** Technical feasibility, data availability, implementation clarity
**Ease (1-10):** Development effort, complexity, dependencies

**ICE Score = (Impact × Confidence × Ease) / 100**

**Example:**
- Impact: 9 (high business value)
- Confidence: 8 (well-understood requirements)
- Ease: 9 (straightforward implementation)
- ICE Score: 6.48 (High Priority)
