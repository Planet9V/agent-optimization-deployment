 continue to use uav-swarm and claude-flow with qdrant and neural critical pattern and learning, saving memories after each task and learning. Always 
use the constitution./home/jim/2_OXOT_Projects_Dev/1_AEON_DT_CyberSecurity_Wiki_Current/00_AEON_CONSTITUTION.md . Your task is to USE TASKMASTER and 
continue to create implemntatoin and detailed reports and test results in the /home/jim/2_OXOT_Projects_Dev/docs/gap-research folder within each 
respective GAP you are working on. We need a taskmaster and plan laid out with spcicise well designed, it appears this is 
/home/jim/2_OXOT_Projects_Dev/docs/gap-research/TASKMASTER_GAP_IMPLEMENTATION.md. You wil be diligence in progressing thes TASKMASTER and claude-flow 
qdrant memory and nerual learning, applying critical analysis and systems thinking to the tasks, to be most effiecnie and highest quality of codeing 
possible, and not breaking or diverging from tasks, but identifying potential issue, and reporting, but always reluying on FACTS, to review he state 
before the task begins, using tghe identified tools/methods/approach previously identified and locaetd in the respective GAP folder in 
/home/jim/2_OXOT_Projects_Dev/docs/gap-research - NO DISTRACTIONS. It appears we are ready to executive ✅ GAP003: PREPARATION COMPLETE (5-day 
implementation plan ready) - am I correct, is this now the next step? and hten we will progrsess each task in order until the GAP003 is complete and 
TESTED ?
