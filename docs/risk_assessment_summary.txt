CVE ID NORMALIZATION RISK ASSESSMENT SUMMARY
============================================

RECOMMENDATION: GO (WITH CRITICAL SAFEGUARDS)
RISK LEVEL: HIGH → MEDIUM (with mitigation)

KEY FINDINGS:
- Nodes to normalize: 179,522
- Duplicate conflicts: 321 (require merge strategy)
- Relationships affected: 1,968,338
- Execution time: 15-30 minutes
- Rollback: IRREVERSIBLE (requires full backup)

CRITICAL SAFEGUARDS REQUIRED (ALL MANDATORY):
1. Full data backup (neo4j-admin dump) - NOT YET CREATED
2. Merge strategy implementation - CREATED
3. Pre-normalization validation - CREATED
4. Rollback plan - DOCUMENTED
5. Execution window scheduling - NOT SCHEDULED
6. Stakeholder approval - PENDING

RISK SCORE:
- Without safeguards: 9/10 CRITICAL
- With safeguards: 4/10 MEDIUM (ACCEPTABLE)

CREATED DELIVERABLES:
1. docs/CVE_ID_NORMALIZATION_RISK_ASSESSMENT.md (full report)
2. docs/CVE_NORMALIZATION_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md (stakeholder summary)
3. scripts/merge_duplicate_cve_nodes.cypher (execution script)
4. scripts/create_neo4j_full_backup.sh (backup script)
5. scripts/validate_cve_ids.cypher (validation queries)
6. scripts/rollback_cve_normalization.cypher (limited rollback)

NEXT ACTIONS:
1. Execute create_neo4j_full_backup.sh
2. Run validation queries
3. Review duplicate conflicts (321 expected)
4. Obtain stakeholder approval
5. Schedule off-peak execution window
6. Execute merge_duplicate_cve_nodes.cypher

ASSESSMENT COMPLETED: 2025-11-01 19:45:00 UTC
STATUS: READY FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW
