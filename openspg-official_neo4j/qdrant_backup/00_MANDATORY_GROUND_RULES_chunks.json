These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE and MUST be followed by all team members, automated processes, and third-party contributors without exception. Violation of these rules will result in immediate work stoppage and mandatory rollback procedures.\n\nThe purpose of these ground rules is to protect the integrity of the existing 147,923 CVE nodes and 35,146 supporting nodes (183,069 total) while enabling systematic enhancement to reach the target state of 307,569+ nodes.

CVE PRESERVATION POLICY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\n\n### 1.1 The Sacred 147,923: Absolute Protection\n\nThe 147,923 CVE nodes represent the foundation and primary value of this ontology. These nodes are the result of extensive data ingestion, validation, and relationship mapping that cannot be recreated without significant cost and risk. Therefore, the following rules apply:\n\n**RULE 1.1.1 - Zero CVE Node Deletion**: Under NO circumstances shall any of the 147,923 CVE nodes be deleted, archived, deprecated, or marked as inactive. Every CVE node that exists today must exist in every future version of the ontology.\n\n**RULE 1.1.2 - No CVE Re-Import**: The CVE data import pro",

These properties may only be updated to correct factual errors, never for schema restructuring purposes.\n\n**RULE 1.1.4 - Relationship Addition Only**: New relationships may be added to CVE nodes to connect them to enhancement nodes. Existing relationships to CVE nodes may NOT be removed unless proven to be factually incorrect.\n\n### 1.2 Verification and Protection Procedures\n\n**RULE 1.2.1 - Pre-Enhancement CVE Census**: Before any enhancement wave begins, an automated census must ",
